In this topic, you're learning about the steps involved in planning a successful design sprint, even if you're not the one leading it. 

Here's a summarized list of the 7 key steps covered:
+ User Research: Identify the user problems you aim to address during the sprint.
+ Expert Consultation: Schedule discussions with colleagues or industry experts to gain insights related to the sprint's focus.
+ Secure the Right Space: Find a location that accommodates everyone's needs, with whiteboards, good acoustics, and comfortable furniture.
+ Gather Supplies: Ensure you have all the necessary materials, such as markers, sticky notes, snacks, and water.
+ Establish Ground Rules: Set clear expectations for behavior and engagement during the sprint.
+ Plan Introductions: Use icebreakers to help team members get to know each other and foster a collaborative environment.
+ Post-Sprint Planning: Determine how to use the insights gained from the sprint and assign documentation responsibilities.

Keep in mind that each of these steps contributes to a well-structured and productive design sprint.
