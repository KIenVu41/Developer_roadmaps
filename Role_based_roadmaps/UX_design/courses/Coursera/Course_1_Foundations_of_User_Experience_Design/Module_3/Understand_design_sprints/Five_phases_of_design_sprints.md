- Phase 1: Understand
+ This phase is all about gaining a deep understanding of the design challenge.
+ The team would conduct research, analyze data, and interview stakeholders to define the problem clearly.
+ For example, in the Cycling Enthusiasts app scenario, the team needed to understand why sales were slumping and what cyclists were looking for in an app.

- Phase 2: Ideate
+ This is the brainstorming phase where the team generates a wide range of potential solutions.
+ The key here is to encourage creativity and explore all possibilities, no matter how unconventional they may seem.
+ The video mentions sketching ideas as a way to visualize and communicate them effectively.

Phase 3: Decide
+ With a collection of ideas generated, the team now needs to converge and decide on the most viable solution to move forward with.
+ This involves evaluating the pros and cons of each idea, considering factors like feasibility, user needs, and business goals.
+ The goal is to have a clear direction for the prototype phase.

- Phase 4: Prototype
+ This phase involves building a tangible representation of the chosen solution.
+ The prototype doesn't have to be perfect or fully functional, but it should be realistic enough to test with users.
+ The focus is on creating a tangible artifact that users can interact with.

- Phase 5: Test
+ The final phase is all about putting the prototype in front of real users to gather feedback.
+ This helps identify any usability issues, uncover user preferences, and validate design decisions.
+ The insights gathered from user testing are then used to iterate and improve the design before launch.

- Remember, the design sprint is an iterative process. The insights gained from each phase can be used to refine the design and ensure that the final product meets the needs of the users.
