You’ve learned that good UX designers consider business requirements at every stage of the design thinking process. These requirements are set by whatever business or entity assigns the design project. They include crucial details like a business’s schedule, budget, and vision for the product that’s being designed.

After understanding these requirements, designers are ready to start the first phase of the design thinking process: empathize. 

When you empathize with people, you try to deeply understand their feelings, thoughts, and experiences on their own terms, without bias or preconceptions. Empathizing helps designers connect with users, not just as consumers or customers, but as human beings with their own unique histories and situations. This kind of deep connection helps designers create products that solve real problems, address real needs, and engage users in the long term. 

Building on business requirements
When empathizing, designers seek to understand how users experience the product they’re designing. They want to know their users’ problems and needs, and they want a clear understanding of the situations and environments where users interact with the product. The more a designer understands these details, the better equipped they are to create products that truly meet users’ needs in the long term.

Some of this user information will likely be included in the project’s business requirements, but it may be limited or based on assumptions. That’s why good UX designers use the empathize phase to validate, update, and expand on the user information in their project’s business requirements. They do this by connecting directly with users and researching their experiences. 

Here are some powerful methods for empathizing with users as a UX designer:

Interviews
Interviews take many forms, but UX designers most commonly use four: 

Questionnaires/surveys

In-person interviews

Phone interviews

Video interviews

Before starting interviews, designers consider the type and amount of information they need. Next, good designers consider their business requirements: how much time, money, and other resources do they have for planning and conducting interviews? Finally, designers can plan interviews that achieve the best balance between their information needs and their project’s parameters. 

Empathy maps
Once designers have conducted their interviews, they can turn to empathy maps. These are a great tool for processing the information a designer has collected. In a classic empathy map, designers draw directly from interviews to answer five questions about their users:

Who exactly are the users and what are their situations?

What do users say about their experiences with the product or similar products?

What do users think about their experiences?

What do users do before, during, and after their experiences?

What do users feel about their experiences?

Ideally, the answers to these questions will build on any user information included in a project’s business requirements. 

For example, in the business requirements you explored in the previous reading, the bakery owner claims their older customers prefer ordering over the phone because they aren’t comfortable with online order forms. But the UX designer’s empathy research tells a different story: Many older customers are comfortable with online ordering but prefer phone ordering because they think it’s faster and feel an emotional connection with the bakery and its staff. In this way, the designer’s empathy research has updated and expanded the user information in the bakery’s business requirements. 

User personas
Personas are fictional characters who represent groups of similar users. They help designers distill large amounts of user information into more manageable chunks. 

For example, the older bakery customers  prefer ordering over the phone for a mix of reasons. But rather than try to remember these details in the abstract, the designer creates a user persona who brings this customer to life: 

Berta is an older customer who has built connections with bakery staff over time and enjoys connecting with them while ordering over the phone. Also, she has a visual impairment and finds phone ordering faster and more convenient than ordering online.

Once designers have established personas, they can keep their users in mind throughout the design thinking process without having to remember every detail they captured during their interviews. These personas also help designers explain their design choices to clients and other business stakeholders. Rather than try to describe their users in the abstract, they use user personas to tell compelling stories that put their designs in context.

Key takeaways
In the empathize phase of design thinking, designers seek to understand their users through a variety of research methods, including interviews, empathy maps, and user personas.

The goal of empathizing is to understand  users' problems, wants, needs, and situations in order to design a product that works for them and creates an enjoyable experience. Throughout this phase, good UX designers try to understand users as deeply as they can while still working within key business requirements, like timeline and budget.
