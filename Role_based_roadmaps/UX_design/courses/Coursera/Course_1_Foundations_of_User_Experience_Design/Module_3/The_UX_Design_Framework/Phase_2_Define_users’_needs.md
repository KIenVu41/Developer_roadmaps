You’ve learned that effective UX designers typically start the design thinking process only after they’ve understood their project’s goals, parameters, and other business requirements. You’ve also learned about the first phase of the design thinking process: empathize. Empathizing is all about connecting with users, gathering information about them, and distilling that information into detailed user personas. 

Process flow that represents the Design Thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. TestProcess flow that represents the Design Thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test. Define is highlighted.
After empathizing, designers move to the next phase of design thinking: define. In the define phase, designers analyze their empathy work to answer this key question: Which of my users’ needs or problems are the most important ones for my design to address? Typically, designers use a combination of tools to answer this question. 

User stories
While a user persona distills a large group of similar users into a single character, user stories help designers focus their understanding of those users even more. A user story is a one-sentence narrative told from a persona’s perspective. It should encapsulate who the user is, what they want to do, and why they want to do it. The following is a simple template for writing a user story: 

As [type of user], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

When done well, a user story gives the designer information they can use to create a checklist they can return to as they define their users’ needs and ideate effective solutions. For example, recall Berta, one of the user personas in the bakery example you’ve been exploring. For Berta, the UX designer might develop a user story like this:

As a long-time customer with a visual impairment and a close connection to the bakery staff, I want to place my orders over the phone so I can order with ease and continue to connect with staff members.

User journeys 
Once a designer has distilled their user groups into realistic personas and stories, it’s time to start mapping out each persona’s user journey. A user journey is a series of experiences that the user has as they try to achieve their goal. It might be an experience they have with the product that’s being designed, an experience they have with a similar product, or an experience they have in the absence of those products. 

In developing the new bakery website, for example, the UX designer creates two user journeys for each persona, including Berta. One of Berta’s user journeys reflects how users like her typically interact with the bakery and its current ordering systems (a mixture of phone ordering and direct messages on social media accounts). The other user journey reflects how users like Berta will typically interact with website-based ordering systems, which is the type of product the designer is creating.

Problem statements
With complete user journeys for each persona, a designer can better identify the problems their design must solve or the needs their design must address. Then, they can distill these problems or needs into problem statements. 

A problem statement summarizes who the user is, what they need from a design, and why. The following is a simple template for writing a problem statement:

[Name of user persona] is a [type of user] who needs [type of user experience] because [benefits of user experience].

This template is similar to a user story, but problem statements are typically more detailed, and they are written from the designer’s perspective. For example, here’s a problem statement for Berta:

Berta is an older person with a visual impairment. She is a long-time bakery customer who prefers ordering over the phone. She needs a website and online ordering system that are easy to use, adapt to her vision needs, and mimic the feel and flow of a friendly phone conversation. She wants to place her orders with ease and feel like she’s making a personal connection with the bakery.

Effective UX designers create problem statements for each of their user personas. This helps designers create products that address the needs of multiple user types rather than catering solely to one type of user. 

Key takeaways
In the define phase of design thinking, designers build on their business requirements and empathy work to state a series of specific problems they want their design to address. These problems should emerge from a thorough understanding of who users are and how they experience the product, including the specific tasks they encounter and the feelings they bring to those tasks, such as placing orders at a bakery.
