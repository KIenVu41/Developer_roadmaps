Once designers have built a prototype, it’s time to test it. Testing is the fifth phase of the design thinking process. And, as you’ve already learned, testing often happens in cycles with prototyping.

Think back to the bakery example from previous readings. The UX designer organized the content and visuals of the website with information architecture and a sitemap. Then, they went through iterations of wireframing, eventually creating a low-fidelity prototype and then a high-fidelity prototype.

At some point in the prototyping phase, designers typically start testing their prototypes and making improvements. Effective testing aims to reveal what users think, feel, and experience as they use a product, such as a website or an app. To get rich and unbiased results, good testing starts with a plan. Let’s briefly explore the key elements of UX testing by considering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of a testing plan:

Who will participate in the tests? Early on, designers might ask friends, colleagues, design partners, or other informal participants to test a product and offer feedback. Later on, ideal participants include real-life users who align with the project’s user personas.

What types of tests will be conducted? In upcoming courses, you’ll learn more about different types of UX research and UX tests, including the kinds of information they help designers collect.

When and where will the tests be conducted? Tests can be conducted in person or virtually, in a range of different environments or communication channels. It all depends: Good UX designers plan tests that achieve the best balance between their needs and their project’s business requirements.

Why are the tests conducted? UX tests are conducted for a range of reasons, but the core goal is always to understand users and improve their experiences. During the test phase of design thinking, some of the most common reasons for testing are to:

Validate ideas, information, or decisions from other parts of the design thinking process, such as user information generated during the empathize phase or design decisions made during ideation. 

Uncover usability issues to address with further iteration and prototyping. Users experience these issues as pain points that prevent them from using the product and achieving their goals with ease and enjoyment.

How will participants engage with the prototype? Here, a key consideration is whether the testing process itself is inclusive and accessible for all participants. As you’ll learn, effective testing incorporates assistive technologies and other inclusive elements to ensure all participants can engage fully.

How will information be collected? Designers use a range of methods to collect information from users, including observation and interviews. They may also be able to gather information from the prototype itself or the systems that participants use to interact with the prototype.

For the bakery, the UX designer tested a low-fidelity prototype and then a high-fidelity prototype with a range of users who aligned with the project’s key user personas, including Berta. Through user feedback, the designer discovered key ways to improve the website and better meet users’ needs. With some time and further iteration, the designer eventually created a successful design that met his client’s business requirements while also creating an easy and enjoyable experience for users. Now it’s time for some pastries!

Key takeaways
In the test phase, the goal is to refine the prototype as designers gain insight into whether or not it solves the defined problem. Once the testing is done, the prototype will be finalized, and the prototype will move on to the developers, who will turn the design into the actual product.
