You’ve learned that design thinking is a user-centered and multi-stage approach to solving problems. Its goal is to create products that effectively address real user needs. And it has five phases: empathizing with users, defining their needs, ideating solutions, prototyping solutions, and testing those solutions.

Process flow that represents the Design Thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test.
You’ve also learned that while this process looks neat and linear, the reality is often more cyclical. The best UX designers iterate throughout the process, moving back and forth between stages to do things like redefine user needs or develop alternative prototypes.

In fact, in many real-world situations, design thinking doesn’t even start with empathizing. Instead, it starts when a designer gets an assignment for a new project. Good UX designers take time to carefully understand these assignments before they move forward. Why? Because most assignments include crucial business requirements that must be considered at every stage of the design thinking process. 

Business requirements  
For any UX design project, business requirements come from whatever entity assigns the project. That entity might be a for-profit business, a nonprofit organization, a governmental organization, or something else. But no matter where they come from, business requirements typically include two kinds of information: goals and parameters.

Business goals typically describe:

The users they want the design to target

The outcomes they want the design to achieve

Their vision for the design’s final look and functionality

Business parameters typically describe:

The project’s budget, timeline, and scope

The specific tools and systems that designers must use or design for

The requirements and standards the design must meet

Business requirements vary depending on the project and its key players, and they can often be negotiated over the project’s lifecycle. And just as these requirements may evolve over the course of the project, so too should they shape designers’ execution of the design thinking process in powerful ways. In the empathize phase, for example, UX designers connect with users and gather information about their needs. This task costs time and money, so it should be conducted in ways that fit the project’s schedule and budget. 

Here’s an example of a UX designer encountering business requirements for a new project. As you learn about design thinking in upcoming readings, you’ll explore examples of how this UX designer creates an effective product while meeting business requirements. 


A bakery owner is contracting a freelance UX designer to design a new website. The bakery serves customers exclusively through delivery and pick-up orders. Since its founding two years ago, the bakery has advertised and taken orders over the phone and through its social media accounts. This approach has helped the bakery connect directly with customers and build a loyal base without partnering with third-party ordering services.

But as sales have increased, the owner and their team have struggled to individually process orders as they come in through multiple channels. They need a website that will help them maintain a direct connection with customers while enabling them to process orders in a more automated and efficient way.

When they contract with their freelance UX designer, the bakery owner shares their goals and parameters. With a modest budget and relatively short time-frame, they want a simple website that supports online ordering without routing users to third-party ordering services. The site must be easy to navigate, maintain, and update. It must also reflect the bakery’s existing brand and appeal to its target customers. While the bakery’s customers come from a range of locations and demographics, the majority are 35–70 years old and they live or work in the local area.

These business requirements provide an invaluable starting point for the designer, who reviews them to learn more about their end users, understand their budget and timeframe, and start planning the rest of their design thinking process.

Key takeaways
Though design thinking technically starts with empathizing, actual design projects typically start with business requirements. Business requirements are goals and parameters set by whatever business or other entity is assigning the design project. They state crucial details like the business’s budget, timeframe, and vision for the design. Effective UX designers understand these requirements and consider them at every stage of the Design Thinking process. You’ll learn more about the first phase of design thinking—and how it’s shaped by business requirements—in the next reading.
