When a designer has empathized with their users, defined their users’ needs, and ideated solutions, it’s time to start the fourth phase of design thinking: prototyping solutions.

In the prototyping phase, the goal is not to build a final product. Rather, designers produce early models, or prototypes, of the solution so they can see how it will look and function for users. Prototypes also show stakeholders and potential users what the design can do. So, how do designers prototype? There are many practices they can use.  

Information architecture and sitemaps
To meet users’ needs, products like web apps must present information in ways that users can understand and navigate with ease and enjoyment. When designers organize the information in a product, they create something called “information architecture,” or IA. Information architecture is essentially a high-level diagram or flowchart that shows how users can move through a product, like a website or an app.

In planning a product’s information architecture, designers often create something called a sitemap, like this one for a website:

Sitemap showing main categories. Under each category shows six subcategories reading left to right:Shop with seven subcategories below; Lookbooks with four subcategories; Search filters includes price, color, size, material, online-only, popularity and sale; Log In/Sign up includes forgot password and create account; Cart with five subcategories; and Footer/Other which includes general information about the business and help.
Like all good information architecture, this sitemap organizes the product by outlining its hierarchy and sequence:

Hierarchy refers to how topics are prioritized and subordinated. Hierarchies emphasize topics that are broader or more important, which in turn contain smaller or less important topics. In the sitemap above, for example, “Shop” is a major topic that contains smaller topics, like “Denim/Pants.”

Sequence refers to the order in which users can navigate through the product’s hierarchy, like navigating from the “Homepage” to “Shop” to “Denim/Pants” and so on.

Information architecture and sitemaps are crucial for meeting users’ needs. For example, recall the designer who is developing a website and online ordering system for a bakery. One of the designer’s user personas is an older customer who prefers phone ordering because they enjoy talking with bakery staff. 

So, the designer aims to create a website and ordering system that replicate the experience of ordering over the phone. The design’s success will depend in large part on its information architecture. In creating the website’s sitemap, for instance, the designer uses hierarchy and then sequences information so that users enter the homepage and immediately see an option to “Place an Order,” just as they might be invited to place an order after being greeted by bakery staff over the phone.

Wireframing
Wireframes are rough sketches of the product that bring the sitemap to life. Designers use them to figure out how the product’s pages are laid out, how each page’s elements are arranged, and how users will progress from page to page. They are relatively bare bones, consisting primarily of shapes, lines, and minimal text. There are two methods designers can employ:

Paper wireframes
Paper wireframes are sketches on paper. They use horizontal lines to represent text, rectangles or boxes to represent icons or images, and other shapes to represent buttons and additional elements. It’s easy and inexpensive to iterate many versions with paper. 

Example of paper wireframes showing eight screens that are drawn with pencil and paper.
Digital wireframes
Digital wireframes are developed in a UX design tool such as Figma or Adobe XD. Digital wireframes are 2D designs that show, at a high level, what the product will look like. Designers use grayscale, shapes, and placeholder text to demonstrate what the design will look and feel like when content is added. (On a fun side-note: Lorem ipsum is a form of placeholder text that is so common that many designers like to play around with it for fun, to inspire creativity. Check out

Low fidelity (lo-fi) prototypes
In UX, “fidelity” means how closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product. A low fidelity prototype is a simple interactive model that provides a basic idea of what the product will look like and how its components will flow for users. Designers often create lo-fi prototypes by assembling their wireframes and adding interactivity, or the ability to navigate from one screen to another. Designers use lo-fi prototypes to test and improve their designs before spending time and effort developing more detailed high-fidelity prototypes. 

High fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes
A high fidelity prototype takes the lo-fi prototype and brings it as close to the final product as possible. Hi-fi prototypes incorporate all of the product’s components, interactivity, and content, though some content may be represented by realistic placeholders. It is not the final product, but it enables people to more fully experience how the product will look, feel, and work. For example, consider the richly detailed hi-fi prototype for Tee’s Shirts below. More than just an assembly of navigable wireframes, this hi-fi prototype will enable testers and stakeholders to simulate a realistic experience with the final product, which means richer and more detailed feedback for designers on every facet of the final product.

Hi-fi prototype example for Tee’s Shirts website.
During prototyping, whether lo-fi or hi-fi, designers often revisit information and decisions from earlier stages of the design thinking process. When evaluating prototypes, for example, they should ask if the layout, flow, look, and feel address the problem statement developed during the define phase. Would Berta, the bakery customer persona you met earlier, be able to easily use the site to order? Does the site give her the personal experience she’s used to and looking for? These are all things for the bakery’s UX designer to consider when taking a critical look at prototypes. 

Prototyping and testing 
You’ve read about designers creating prototypes so people can experience what the product will look and feel like. If you think that sounds like testing, the next phase of the design thinking process, then you’re right: prototyping and testing are deeply interconnected. In the next reading, you’ll see how these phases work in tandem. Keep exploring to find out what happens next!

Key takeaways
Design thinking has five phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. It is a cyclical and iterative process that requires UX designers to revisit the different phases as needed. In the prototype phase, UX designers will create a model of the product. To do this, they’ll use various practices such as:

Information architecture

Sitemaps

Wireframing (paper and digital)

Lo-fi prototypes

Hi-fi prototypes 

The goal of prototyping is to have a model to test and gain feedback on. The prototyping and testing phases of design thinking work in tandem.
