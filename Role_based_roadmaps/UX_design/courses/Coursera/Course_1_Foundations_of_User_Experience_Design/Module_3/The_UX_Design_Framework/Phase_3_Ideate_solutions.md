In the second phase of design thinking, designers build on their empathy research to define and select the user problems they need to address. In the third phase, they ideate possible solutions to those problems.

The ideate phase is all about getting creative and brainstorming lots of potential solutions. Designers often collaborate with team members, business stakeholders, and potential users. Their ideas may be unexpected or out of the box, and that’s great! 

Early in the ideate phase, good designers try to suspend their assumptions, preconceptions, and judgements: The goal is to propose, consider, and challenge as many alternatives as possible without evaluating or selecting any one. Evaluation and selection come in later in the ideate phase: Once plenty of ideas are on the table, designers have a better chance to compare alternatives and select the best.

As you’ll learn in a later course, there are many, many different techniques for brainstorming, and the best UX designers choose, adapt, and create new techniques as needed. For now,  here are some of the most common:

“How might we?”
In this brainstorming exercise, designers take a problem statement from the define phase and turn it into a list of questions that start with “How might we,” or HMW.  HMW questions help designers reframe user problems as exciting opportunities for solutions. For example, recall the problem statement you explored in the previous reading defining user needs:

Berta is an older person with a visual impairment. She is a long-time bakery customer who prefers ordering over the phone. She needs a website and online ordering system that are easy to use, adapt to her vision needs, and mimic the feel and flow of a friendly phone conversation. She wants to place her orders with ease and feel like she’s making a personal connection with the bakery as she places her orders.

If the bakery’s UX designer reframed this problem statement as a series of HMW questions, they might include:

How might we make the online ordering process easy to use?

How might we make the online ordering system mimic a friendly conversation?

How might we ensure the online ordering system adapts to Berta’s vision needs?

After creating these HMW questions, good UX designers spend time answering them with as many possible solutions as they can think of—and they don’t hold back!

Rapid Sketching
While “How might we?” focuses on written questions and solutions, Rapid Sketching is a visual approach to ideation. (It’s commonly called “Crazy Eights” in the UX design industry.) Rapid Sketching is especially useful when designers need to brainstorm the visual elements of a new design. First, designers clarify the problem they’re trying to solve or the idea they’re trying to iterate. They might use one of the questions or solutions they developed in a HMW exercise. Then, they:

Divide a large sheet of paper into eight squares.

Grab something to draw with.

Start an eight-minute timer.

Take one minute to sketch an idea or solution in each square.

When the eight-minute timer goes off, there should be a different sketch in each of the paper’s eight squares. Designers can adapt this approach as needed. For example, if a designer has less time or smaller sheets of paper, they might start with four squares and four minutes for sketching.

Competitive audits
When designers want new ideas about how to solve a problem, they can also audit their competitors by asking questions, like: 

What products do they offer? 

What are those products’ strengths and areas for improvement? 

By answering questions like these, designers can get inspiration for their own designs, identify gaps in the market, and find evidence for what designs have already worked and not worked.  With audits, designers can save time, money, and effort by learning from competitors who have already designed similar products or tried to solve similar problems.

SCAMPER
SCAMPER is a technique designers used to brainstorm changes and alternatives to ideas and designs. Each letter of the acronym stands for a different action that designers can apply to their designs, such as substituting (S) elements for other elements, combining (C) elements into one, or adapting (A) elements with alternatives. In full, the acronym stands for: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Rearrange. 

Collaboration
Ideation typically works best when it’s collaborative. Effective design teams often ideate together in collaborative working sessions. And whether they’re working alone or in a team, designers often bring other players into the ideation process, including their users and their business stakeholders. 

Before launching a collaborative partnership or working session, effective designers or design teams typically ensure they’ve answered crucial questions such as:

Who will be involved? What will their roles be?

Where will the collaboration happen? Will it be in person or virtual?

Why is the collaboration happening? What is the end goal?

How will the collaboration happen? What tools and processes will we use?

Business requirements
Ideation techniques help designers brainstorm lots of ideas, but will those ideas meet their project’s business requirements? As designers review their ideas, they must refer to their business requirements and ask questions like these:

Which of these ideas will be feasible within the project’s budget and schedule?

Which of these ideas will best meet the standards for the design?

While ideation starts with exploring boundless possibilities, there will always be firm parameters for a project. Good UX designers often try to frame these parameters positively: They are obstacles that inspire creative problem solving, guardrails that keep the design process on track, and filters for sifting through all those boundless possibilities. 

Key takeaways
In the ideate phase of design thinking, UX designers brainstorm lots of possible solutions to the user problems they’ve identified. They use brainstorming and research techniques like “How might we?” (HMW), Rapid Sketching, competitive audits, and SCAMPER. It should be a fun, creative, and judgment-free process: The more ideas, the better! But once the ideas are out there, good UX designers take time to check possible solutions against their project’s business requirements. Ultimately, their goal is to choose the solution that will satisfy requirements while also working best for users.
