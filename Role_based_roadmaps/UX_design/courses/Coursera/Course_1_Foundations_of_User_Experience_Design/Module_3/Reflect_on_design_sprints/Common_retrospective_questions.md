Every design sprint is an opportunity for the team to learn something new. Design sprints are especially useful for entry-level UX designers joining a design sprint for the first time. 

During a design sprint, the focus is on: 

Understanding the design challenge 

Ideating solutions 

Deciding which solutions to build 

Prototyping a few solutions 

Testing those prototypes

Immediately following a design sprint, the team should hold a retrospective. A retrospective is a collaborative critique of the design sprint process. 

Collaborative critiques play an essential role throughout the Design Thinking process, particularly during the prototyping and testing phases. These critiques focus on improving the design solution itself, considering factors like usability, visuals, and alignment with user needs. 

A design sprint retrospective is also a feedback-oriented activity within the Design Thinking process, but it has a different goal. The goal of a design sprint retrospective is to make sure everyone who took part in the sprint has the chance to give feedback and think about opportunities for improving the process. 

The key questions to ask during a retrospective are: 

What went well? 

What can be improved? 

Answering these questions will help the individuals and the team work better. It is important for everyone to feel empowered to share their experiences and to know that personal identifiers, like race or gender, don’t prevent members from being honest. Before a retrospective begins, remember that any feedback provided will be used to reflect on the experience and improve the process for the next sprint. 


What went well?
Retrospectives usually start with discussion on the parts of the design sprint that were successful and areas in which the team did well. Maybe a new process was created that could be applied to future sprints. Or maybe the addition of a new digital tool enhanced the team’s productivity. Analyze the team’s wins, and think about how they could be applied to future sprints.

Questions a UX designer might ask during this part of the retrospective include:

Which tools saved me the most time and effort?

When did I feel the most satisfaction?

What helped me make my best contribution to the team during this sprint?

This is also a good time to acknowledge a team member’s strong performance. Celebrating successes builds relationships and increases cohesion and harmony within the team.


What can be improved?
After highlighting everything that went well, it’s time to shift gears and think about areas for improvement. The team will want to know what went wrong, so that everyone can do better next time. 

Retrospectives are opportunities to encourage everyone to participate in sharing areas for improvement. Each individual might even take turns going around a circle and adding challenges to a shared list. If anyone is nervous about speaking up, each person can be invited to write their thoughts anonymously. Then, all of the improvements can be reviewed together. 

This process eliminates concerns about causing offense and reduces the chance of groupthink. Groupthink can occur in a group discussion when one person shares an opinion and everyone immediately agrees with the opinion, instead of sharing their own feelings about a topic. Groupthink prevents each person from having an equal say, and it might mean certain areas for improvement are overlooked.

Consider each phase of the design sprint to structure the feedback: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and test. At what point were there missteps? What caused those challenges? Share individual perspectives if a phase or two didn’t go according to plan. 

Questions a UX designer might ask during this part of the retrospective include:

What went wrong that caught me off guard?

Which problems came up the most often?

When do I think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?

Then, a designer examines the sprint’s outcome or final product, and ask questions like:

Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design?

Did an external factor derail my productivity?

Most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem?

Identify ways that the team could have ended up with a better solution. 

Keep in mind, retrospectives are about empowering—not shaming. This is not the time to call out an individual for poor performance. If there are issues with a team member’s work, it’s best to address it with that person privately, not during a team-wide retrospective.


Lessons learned
By the end of the retrospective meeting, the team will have a better understanding of what went well and what could be improved. Naturally, they’ll want to take lessons learned into their next design sprint. 

Before the next sprint, the team reviews the conclusions reached at the end of the last retrospective. The conclusions should inform how they conduct the next sprint. Perhaps they need to include a more diverse team, allow more time for ideating, or test with additional users before moving forward with a design.

Questions a UX designer might ask include:

What did I discover during the sprint that I’m still wondering about?

How could the current process be holding the team back from creating better solutions?

Key takeaways
Remember: In Design Thinking, collaboration and feedback during a retrospective are crucial for refining and improving designs. In a retrospective, a UX designer should be sure to speak up and share suggestions for how the next design sprint could be better. They should not be afraid to suggest anything they think will improve the project or next sprint. The only bad suggestion is the one not shared.
