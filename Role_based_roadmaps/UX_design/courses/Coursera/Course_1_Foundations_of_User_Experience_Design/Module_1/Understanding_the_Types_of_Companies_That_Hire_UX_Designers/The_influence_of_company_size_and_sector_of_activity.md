1. Startups and small businesses
Startups are new businesses that want to develop a unique product or service and bring it to market. Small businesses are privately owned companies with a small number of employees. Many UX designers are excited to start their work in startups or small businesses because they can see the impact of their work more quickly and develop a broader range of skills.
- Pros:
+ Team Size: Closely-knit team with the ability to work directly with senior management.
+ Growth: Opportunity for growth due to taking on many responsibilities (visual design, interaction design, user research, and more).
+ Creativity: Generally more creative freedom with fewer guidelines and processes.
+ Impact: Lots of impact on final products, with few people working on a project.
- Cons:
+ Mentoring: Fewer mentors to choose from in a small business.
+ Responsibility: Most of the responsibilities of a UX project rest solely on you, which can be stressful if you have little UX experience.
+ Speed: You must be comfortable working quickly and turning out imperfect work with little supervision.

2. Large companies
At a large company, like Google, you’re likely to work as part of a team on a specific project. Many UX designers want to work at large companies with the people who have built some of the world’s most famous products. UX teams at large companies tend to be more compartmentalized by specialization, making it easier for you to become an expert in a particular area of ​​UX.
- Pros:
+ Mentorship : A variety of experienced designers and other UXers you can learn from.
+ Growth : Lots of growth opportunities because there are many levels of designers and management.
+ Guidelines : Clearer guidelines to keep products consistent and on-brand.
+ Team Size : More people working on a project means you're better able to focus on your specific responsibilities.
+ Specialization : Ability to focus on a particular area of ​​design.
- Cons:
+ Team Size: You may feel like you have less Impact or are less important if you are on a project with a lot of other designers.
+ Impact: You may feel like there are few of you in a company with so many features and products.
+ Guidelines: Defined guidelines can restrict creativity.

3. Design agencies
A design agency is a one-stop shop for visual brands, products, and services. Working at a design agency can be similar, in some ways, to working at a small business or startup, except you have multiple companies as clients. Many agencies tend to work on a wide range of products, so you can explore many different types of styles and approaches to UX design.
- Pros:
+ Impact: Lots of impact on projects, if you are the only UX designer on the team.
+ Network: Opportunity to work with relevant people, different teams and diverse clients.
+ Exposure: Exposure to many companies and industries with different clients.
+ Resume: Portfolio of working with major brands and displaying this work in your portfolio.
- Cons:
+ Mentorship: Lack of mentorship if you are the only UX designer on a project.
+ Monotony: Agency dependencies, you might only work on the same type of projects.
+ Ownership: You may not be able to work on a project from start to finish.
+ Finished Product: The products you work on might not be launched, depending on the client's priorities.

4. Advertising agencies
Many UX designers work at advertising agencies , which are teams of creatives hired by clients to build marketing campaigns. Sometimes called “creative technologists,” these designers work to create ads for brands using UX principles. This is a great option if you’re open to learning interesting skills outside of a core UX design role.
- Pros:
+ Autonomy: Little or no middle management means more autonomy over your work.
+ Apprenticeship: Opportunity to learn about other disciplines, such as branding, marketing and graphic design.
+ Diversity: Each project is different depending on the client.
+ Network: Working with a large number of different brands, clients and teams.
- Cons:
+ Specialization: As the projects are very varied, you may not be able to easily acquire specific skills.
+ Relevance: The work may often involve branding and marketing, and may not focus on UX design.
  
5. Independents
Freelancers are independent UX designers who are hired by clients for their independent services. Being a freelancer gives you a lot of freedom, and it’s a great way for new UX designers to gain experience in the field and add work to their portfolio.
- Pros:
+ Schedule: Set your own hours since you are independent.
+ Flexibility: You can freelance while holding down another job or balancing competing priorities.
+ Autonomy: Choose the work you want to do.
+ Experience: Build your portfolio, especially if you don’t have a full-time job in UX.
- Cons:
+ Structure: Someone to report to, meaning you must be responsible for getting the work done on time.
+ Stability: Less stable than working for a company or agency, as work is not always guaranteed.
+ Business: Manage the logistics of your own business, such as filing taxes, invoicing customers, etc.
+ Mentoring: Lack of readily available mentors since you work alone.
