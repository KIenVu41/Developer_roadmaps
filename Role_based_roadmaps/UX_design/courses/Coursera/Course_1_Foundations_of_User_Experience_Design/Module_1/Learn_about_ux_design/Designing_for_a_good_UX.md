- How to start thinking like a UX Designer:
+ Good UX design is about anticipating and preventing user roadblocks. It's about making products that are usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful.
+ Don Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things" introduces the concept of how a user's experience isn't always considered in a product's design, using the example of a poorly designed door (a "Norman door").
+ Good design considers the user's needs. For example, using icons in apps can be aesthetically pleasing and save space, but they need to be clear and understandable.
+ Every design choice should evoke a specific emotion in the user.
+ Start paying attention to the design of everyday objects. Consider what makes their design good or bad, and how it could be improved.
