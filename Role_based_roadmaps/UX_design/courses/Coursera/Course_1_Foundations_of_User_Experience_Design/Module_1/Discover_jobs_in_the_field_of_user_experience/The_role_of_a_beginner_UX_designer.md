- Responsibilities of an Entry-Level UX Designer:  You'll likely wear many hats, gaining experience in various areas:

+ User Research: Understanding user needs, motivations, and pain points through methods like surveys, observations, and interviews.
+ Information Architecture (IA): Organizing and structuring the product in a user-friendly way. Think of it as the product's skeleton.
+ Wireframing: Creating basic outlines or sketches of product screens to visualize design ideas.
+ Prototyping: Building early models of the product to demonstrate functionality.
+ Visual Design: Focusing on the product's appearance and how it connects to functionality.
+ Effective Communication: Collaborating with colleagues through clear and open communication.

- Specialist vs. Generalist vs. T-Shaped Designers:
+ Specialist: Deep expertise in one specific area of UX design (e.g., interaction design).
+ Generalist: Broad skills across multiple UX disciplines. Common for entry-level roles.
+ T-Shaped: A hybrid approach â€“ deep expertise in one area (the vertical bar of the "T") and broad skills in other areas (the horizontal bar).
