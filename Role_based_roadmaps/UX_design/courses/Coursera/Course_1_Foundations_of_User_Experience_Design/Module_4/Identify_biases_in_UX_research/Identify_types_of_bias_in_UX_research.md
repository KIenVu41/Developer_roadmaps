- What is Bias? Favoring or having prejudice against something based on limited information.
- Why is it important for UX Design? Biases can negatively impact product success and professional development by hindering a designer's ability to empathize with users.
- Types of Bias:
+ Confirmation Bias: Looking for information that confirms existing beliefs.
+ False Consensus Bias: Assuming others share your opinions.
+ Recency Bias: Remembering the last thing heard or said most clearly.
+ Primacy Bias: Remembering the first interaction most strongly.
+ Implicit Bias: Unconsciously associating stereotypes with people.
+ Sunk Cost Fallacy: Continuing a task due to invested time/effort, even if it's not the best course of action.
- How to Overcome Bias:
+ Ask open-ended questions during interviews.
+ Practice active listening without inserting personal opinions.
+ Include a large and diverse user sample.
+ Identify and articulate personal assumptions.
+ Take detailed notes or recordings during interviews.
+ Reflect on personal behaviors and ask for feedback to uncover implicit biases.
+ Break down projects into smaller phases with designated stopping points to reassess direction.
