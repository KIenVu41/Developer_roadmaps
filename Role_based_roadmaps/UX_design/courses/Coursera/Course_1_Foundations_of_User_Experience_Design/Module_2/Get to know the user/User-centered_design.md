What is user-centered design?

User-centered design (UCD) is a design approach that prioritizes the end user's needs and experiences throughout the entire design process. 

Key Principles of User-Centered Design:

1. Focus on the User: The user is at the heart of every design decision.
2. Research and Understanding: Thorough research is conducted to understand user needs, behaviors, and goals.
3. Iteration and Testing: Designs are constantly tested and refined based on user feedback.

The Four Steps of User-Centered Design:
1. Understand: Gather insights into the user's needs, pain points, and how they interact with the product or similar products.
2. Specify: Clearly define the user's needs and the specific problem you aim to solve through your design.
3. Design: Develop solutions and create prototypes based on your understanding of the user's needs.
4. Evaluate: Test your designs with real users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
