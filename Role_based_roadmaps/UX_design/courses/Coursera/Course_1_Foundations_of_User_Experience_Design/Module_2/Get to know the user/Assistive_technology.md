This topic explores assistive technologies (AT) and their role in enhancing accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Here are some key takeaways:

+ Assistive Technology (AT): Products, equipment, and systems that improve the learning, working, and daily lives of people with disabilities.
Examples of AT: Range from low-tech tools like pencil holders to high-tech devices like screen readers, voice control systems, and switch devices.
+ Color Modification: Features like high contrast mode and dark mode enhance screen visibility for people with low vision or eye strain.
+ Voice Control and Switch Devices: Enable individuals with limited dexterity to interact with devices without a keyboard or mouse.
+ Screen Readers: Software that reads on-screen text aloud, including interactive elements and alternative text for images, assisting people with limited vision.
+ Alternative Text (Alt Text): Textual descriptions of images that provide context for users who cannot see them, also helpful for low bandwidth connections.
Speech-to-Text: Converts spoken words into text, benefiting users who find it easier to dictate than type.
- The topic emphasizes that AT benefits a wide range of users, not just those with disabilities, and highlights the importance of incorporating accessibility into the UX design process.
