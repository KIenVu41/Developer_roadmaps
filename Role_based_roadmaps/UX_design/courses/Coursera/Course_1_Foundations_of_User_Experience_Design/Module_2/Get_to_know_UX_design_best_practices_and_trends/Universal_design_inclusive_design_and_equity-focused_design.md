- This video dives into user-centered design by exploring three approaches: universal design, inclusive design, and equity-focused design.  While universal design strives for a "one-size-fits-all" solution, it often falls short of meeting everyone's needs. Inclusive design addresses this by considering the diverse needs of users based on factors like ability, race, and gender, ensuring products are usable by a wider range of people.  Equity-focused design takes this further by prioritizing the needs of historically underrepresented groups, aiming to create a more equitable user experience. The video emphasizes that designing with equity requires understanding the difference between equality, which is about giving everyone the same thing, and equity, which focuses on providing everyone with what they need to succeed.  It encourages viewers to embrace accessibility, inclusive design, and equity-focused design as essential principles for building a more inclusive digital world.
