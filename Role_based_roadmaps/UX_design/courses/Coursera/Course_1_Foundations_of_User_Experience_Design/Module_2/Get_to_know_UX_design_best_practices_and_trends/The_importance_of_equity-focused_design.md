- Here are the key points from this video lecture:
+ Equity-focused design ensures products are accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilities.
+ Job applications and census forms highlight the importance of equity-focused design, particularly regarding gender and race. For example, consider if a question is necessary and its wording to avoid bias.
+ Voice assistants initially trained primarily on male voices, highlighting the need for diverse testing to improve product inclusivity.
+ Inclusive imagery represents diverse people through icons, illustrations, and photographs. For example, when designing a mock profile photo, consider inclusivity beyond your own appearance.
- If you keep these points in mind as you design, you'll be off to a great start in creating equitable and inclusive products! Let me know if you have any other questions.
