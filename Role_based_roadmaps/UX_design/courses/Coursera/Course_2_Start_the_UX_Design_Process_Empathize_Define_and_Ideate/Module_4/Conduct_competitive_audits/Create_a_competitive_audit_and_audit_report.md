You’ve learned that a competitive audit is an overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. You’ve also reviewed the steps for conducting an effective audit.  

When conducted effectively, a competitive audit should:

Identify your key competitors

Review the products that your competitors offer

Understand how your competitors position themselves in the market

Examine what your competition does well and what they could do better

Consider how your competitors describe themselves

An effective audit can help:

Inform your design process

Solve usability and accessibility problems

Reveal gaps in the market 

Provide reliable evidence about whether designs work or not 

Save time, money, and energy

In this review, you’ll explore an example of an effective audit for the CoffeeHouse project, including an audit report in which the audit’s findings are summarized and analyzed. When you create a competitive audit for your own portfolio project, use this example to compare and contrast your designs and grow as a user experience designer. 

Outline competitive audit goals 
Before the CoffeeHouse app designer moves into the details of their competitive audit, they define their audit goals. Since the overall project is for the design of the CoffeeHouse app, the goal is to compare the in-app purchasing experience of each competitor. Once the designer chooses their goal, they write that goal in the cell in row 1 where it says “Competitive audit goal.”

Goal: Compare the purchasing experience of each competitor’s app as a new user and a returning user. 

Notice how the designer has created a very specific goal to focus on. They don’t want to know about user experience in general, but rather about users’ purchasing experiences. And they don’t just want to know about users in general; they want to know about new and returning users. Specific audit goals help designers generate more precise and useful findings.

Add competitor names and types to the template
An effective audit should include three to five competitors, ideally a mixture of direct and indirect competitors. Designers typically identify competitors for their products by searching for similar products online. 

In the example, the designer enters competitors’ names in the “Enter competitor” cells in column A, which is located on the left side of the table. Importantly, notice how the designer records which competitor is direct and which is indirect in the cell to the right of the competitor’s name:

JavaMate, a direct competitor

BeanTown, an indirect competitor

As a reminder: 

Direct competitors have offerings that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience. Essentially, you’re both trying to solve the same problem. 

Indirect competitors either have a similar set of offerings, but they focus on a different audience or have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience.

By including both direct and indirect competitors in their audits, designers create a better picture of the full competitive landscape.

Add competitor information to the template 
After listing competitor names in column and identifying the competitor type (direct or indirect)  in column B, the CoffeeHouse designer adds important pieces of general information in Columns C–I: 

Location

Product offering

Price

Website

Business size

Target audience

Unique value

With all this general information in place, the designer can quickly remind themself or inform others about key competitor details:

JavaMate, a direct competitor, is a coffee chain that features a variety of fresh-brewed coffee and specialty drinks.

BeanTown, an indirect competitor, is a subscription mail-order service that sends a monthly supply of roasted coffee beans to subscribers’ homes.

Add research findings to the template
After outlining their audit goals and competitor information, the designer downloads the competitor apps and reviews them carefully. This step takes empathy and imagination: The reviewer tries to imagine the perspective of each user type they identified in their audit goals: new users and returning users. As they gather ideas and insights, they record their findings in the audit template.

Notice how they group their findings to capture ideas about:

Overall first impressions

Interactions, including accessibility, user flow, and navigation

Visual design, including brand identity

Content, including tone and descriptiveness

Within these categories of findings, the designer includes details about what works well, what could be improved, and whether the competitor meets the needs of their target audience. 

Notice how the “First Impressions” section of the spreadsheet is a high-level overview of the competitor’s products. There, the designer focuses on their feelings and impressions rather than on specific features and functions.

Analyze and summarize findings in a report
After adding their audit goals, competitors, and findings into their audit spreadsheet, the CoffeeHouse designer analyzes and summarizes their findings in an audit report.

Review of CoffeeHouse competitive audit report
In their audit report, notice how the designer summarizes their findings in eight categories. It can be helpful to imagine these categories as questions an audit report should answer:

What are your audit goals? The designer imports their audit goals verbatim from their audit template spreadsheet.

Who are your key competitors? The designer describes each competitor in 1–2 sentences, including whether they are direct or indirect competitors.

What are the type and quality of the competitors’ products? The designer describes what each competitor offers, making note of what they do well and what they could do better. Importantly, the designers’ answers here are both complete and relatively brief: no more than a short paragraph (2–5 sentences) for each competitor. 

How do the competitors position themselves in the market? The designer describes each competitor’s target audience in a few sentences, including the characteristics of their ideal customers (age, location, income, spending habits, and so on).

How do the competitors talk about themselves? The designer includes each competitors’ unique value proposition. They summarize what each competitor claims about its offerings in 2–3 sentences.

What are the competitors’ strengths? The designer briefly lists 2–4 things each competitor does particularly well.

What are the competitors’ weaknesses? The designer briefly lists 2–4 things each competitor could do better.

What gaps are there in the competitors’ products? The designer briefly identifies 2–3 gaps in the market that the competitors do not fill. This category can include design or product features, customization options, accessibility elements, and so on.

What opportunities are there for your product to stand out? The designer lists 2–3 opportunities for their product to stand out from its competitors.

Finally, notice how the report builds on the audit findings in two ways:

It distills and summarizes the findings into manageable chunks of information. These chunks will be very helpful when the designer has to share their findings with others or convince stakeholders of their research insights.

It states key trends, themes, and actionable insights that may shape the designer’s design decisions. You can observe these features especially in the later parts of the report: strengths, weaknesses, gaps, and opportunities. For example, under Gaps, notice how the designer observes that both competitors don’t remember past orders or favorites. That gap is an actionable insight that the designer may use to help the CoffeeHouse app stand out. So, under Opportunities, the designer suggests that CoffeeHouse include a quick and easy way for users to reorder previous orders.

Reflect on your competitive audit
In the next activity, you’ll create a competitive audit for your project portfolio. When you do, use the example above for guidance and comparison, and ask yourself the following questions. Does my competitive audit spreadsheet and final report:

Identify three to six key competitors, complete with “direct” and “indirect” designations?

Include clear competitive audit goals at the top?

Review the products that the competitors have to offer? 

Include three to six features for comparing the businesses that are based on the competitive audit goal? 

Include an analysis of trends among competitors? 

Comment on how my competitors position themselves in the market? 

Examine what the competition does well and what they could do better?

Consider how the competitors describe themselves?

Describe the competitors’ strengths and weaknesses? 

Highlight gaps in the competitors’ products? 

Identify opportunities where my product can stand out and make itself unique?
