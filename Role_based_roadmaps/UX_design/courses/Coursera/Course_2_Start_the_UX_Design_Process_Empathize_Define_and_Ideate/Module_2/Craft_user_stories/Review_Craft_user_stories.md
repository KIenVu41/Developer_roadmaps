You’ve learned that a user story is a fictional, one-sentence narrative used to inspire and inform design decisions. Told from a persona’s point of view, it introduces the user, lays out an obstacle, and states the user’s ultimate goal and reasons for that goal.

Like the user personas they’re based on, user stories help teams:

Distill key user characteristics and needs into single characters and succinct stories

Prioritize and unite around clear design goals based on user needs

Take a user-centered approach and make empathetic design decisions

Convince stakeholders by showing how design decisions will help specific types of people

In this review, you will discover user stories based on the business scenario of a hypothetical company, called CoffeeHouse. You will see the CoffeeHouse scenario throughout the course as an opportunity to practice different parts of the UX design process. 


You can find the CoffeeHouse scenario below:

Example user stories
Here are two CoffeeHouse user personas, Anika and Ali, and their user stories:

Anika
User persona

Anika is a marketing intern at a midsized advertising firm. Twice a week, they collect 6–12 coffees from a nearby coffee shop for their team before their morning meeting. But sometimes they find that their order is incomplete or has gotten cold from waiting too long for them to pick it up. They need a way to place an order in advance, track order status, and better plan their arrival for pickup.

User story

As a marketing intern who collects coffee orders for the team, I want to submit and monitor group orders in advance so that I can better manage order accuracy and plan pickup time.

Ali
User persona

Ali is a line cook who lives in a small city and mostly works in the evenings. During the daytime, Ali does an online coding boot camp for 3–4 hours to learn a new employable skill. They usually do the boot camp from local coffee shops, but sometimes they get frustrated at the limited seating. They also worry about losing their table if they get up to place a new coffee or food order. Ali could use the CoffeeHouse app to reserve an in-shop workspace and place their CoffeeHouse order through the app once they’ve arrived. 

User story

As a remote student who spends 3–4 hours a day studying and purchasing products, I want to be able to order without getting up and potentially losing my table so that I can enjoy CoffeeHouse products and continue to work.

These examples meet all the key criteria for effective user stories. Let’s explore those criteria now.

User story template
Each user story follows this classic template:

Diagram of the template for user stories. Who: As a type of user. What: I want to action. Why: so that benefit.
This who-what-why template helps designers craft compelling user stories that concisely express who users are, what they need, and why: 

Who is the “type of user” the product is for.  

What is the “action” the user hopes will happen.

Why is the “benefit” the user wants to achieve from that action.

Notice how each example story neatly fits this template:

Anika
User story template with the type of user, action, and benefit spaces filled in for Anika.
Who: As a marketing intern who collects coffee orders for the team

What: I want to submit and monitor group orders in advance 

Why: So that I can better manage order accuracy and plan pickup time

Ali
User story template with the type of user, action, and benefit spaces filled in for Ali.
Who: As a remote student who spends 3–4 hours a day studying and purchasing products

What: I want to be able to order without getting up and potentially losing my table

Why: So that I can enjoy CoffeeHouse products and continue to work

With these features of a user in view (who, what, and why), designers are better able to make empathetic design decisions that address users’ pain points, appeal to their goals, and meet their needs.

Diverse types of users (Who)
These user stories are also effective because they define users clearly and concisely, including their situations and key characteristics:

Anika is a marketing intern who collects coffee orders for their work team.

Ali is a remote student who spends 3–4 hours a day studying and purchasing products.

Notice also how the stories focus on diverse types of users. 

Here's a refresher on the personas’ information if you need it:

Anika
A junior employee in a busy professional firm who is typically under 23 years of age. 

Several times a week, this customer goes to the CoffeeHouse to pick up an order for themselves and up to twelve coworkers. 

This customer is on a tight schedule and needs to order high-quality CoffeeHouse items in advance and pick them up quickly and efficiently. 

The most common frustration for this type of customer involves the coordination of their pickup. Sometimes a large order is incomplete or incorrect. Other times, the order sits too long and their coffee or hot food items get cold.

Ali
Someone who enjoys hanging out at CoffeeHouse and wants a place outside of their home and workplace where they can be connected and productive. This type of customer varies in age and occupation.

The most common frustrations for this customer involve poor organization at the checkout counter and their inability to find adequate workspace. Waiting in line to place orders and pick up items interrupts their productivity and discourages them from placing an order. It's also important to this customer that they have access to desirable working conditions like a strong Wi-Fi connection and comfortable seating.

Diverse user personas and stories help designers ensure they’re designing accessible products that meet the widest possible range of user needs. They also help designers identify key commonalities between user needs so they can prioritize and unite around the most important ones.

User actions (What)
Next, notice how each example story clearly identifies what the persona hopes will happen, including the pain points they want to avoid. In each story, the what component is an action that will help the persona avoid these pain points and have a better experience: 

Anika’s pain point is having to submit and wait for orders at the coffee shop. The action they want to achieve is the reverse: being able to submit and monitor orders in advance. 

Ali’s pain point is having to get up and potentially lose their table. The action they want to achieve is being able to place an order from their seat.

By defining these actions and their corresponding pain points, the CoffeeHouse designer can better address users’ needs and create a product that avoids frustrating them.

User benefits (Why)
Finally, consider how each story establishes why the user wants the action to happen. For each user, the why goes beyond the desire to avoid pain points: 

Anika wants to better manage order accuracy and plan pickup time when ordering for their team. 

Ali wants to enjoy CoffeeHouse products and continue to work.

Effective UX design addresses users’ pain points while also helping them achieve goals that are meaningful to them. That’s where the why components of user stories come in: By defining the overarching benefits for users, designers can create more meaningful products that are not only convenient and enjoyable but also impactful on a personal level. These benefits also help designers convince stakeholders how specific design decisions will positively impact users.

Review your user stories
We encourage you to create user stories for the user personas in your project portfolio. When you do, consider comparing them to the examples above, and ask yourself these questions. Do they:

Showcase a diverse and representative set of user personas

Define the types of users clearly and concisely, including key situations and characteristics (who)

Establish the action each user hopes will happen, including any relevant pain points they want to avoid (what)

Show the benefit the user will get from the completed action (why)

Key takeaways
In this course and on the job, designing user stories will help you and your teams set goals and understand the problems you’re solving from your user’s perspective. Consider comparing your user stories with the ones in the example.
