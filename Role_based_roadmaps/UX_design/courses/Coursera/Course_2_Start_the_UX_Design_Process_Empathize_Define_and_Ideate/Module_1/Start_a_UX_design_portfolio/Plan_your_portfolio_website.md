You’ve learned that now is a great time to start your portfolio website—so you can build on it as you complete this course. You’ve also explored website builders, reviewed examples of portfolio sites, and learned about their importance. Your portfolio website should be an opportunity for you to demonstrate your design experience, express your personal brand, and communicate your value to potential employers.

You are not required to, but consider starting your portfolio website now so you can populate it with work samples from your portfolio project. Whenever you choose to start, here’s a list of elements to include. 

You might have noticed these elements in action when you explored examples of entry-level UX designer portfolios earlier in the course.

Name and personal logo (if you have one). Clearly list your name at the top of your portfolio website to help visitors easily identify whose work they are reviewing. If you have a personal logo, like a simple icon or a stylized version of your initials, you should consider including that alongside your name, too.

Navigation menu. Navigation is how users move from page to page on a website. Keep the navigation on your portfolio website simple and easy to follow. For example, users should be able to reach the homepage of your portfolio website from any part of your site, and your navigation titles should be clear and accurate.

Work samples. The focus of your portfolio website is to highlight samples of your UX design work. For example, you will create three projects during this certificate program that you can showcase on your portfolio website. When planning your portfolio website, be sure to choose a layout that will let work samples shine!

“About Me.” Plan to create a page on your portfolio website where visitors learn more about your interests, experiences, and passions. You'll create an "About Me" page for your portfolio website in an upcoming activity of the course.

Contact information. On your portfolio website, it's helpful to provide information about how people can contact you. For example, you should provide your email address, a link to your resume, and links to your professional online profiles (like LinkedIn), so visitors can contact you about potential job opportunities. Wherever possible, try to use professional-looking naming, like an email address of [YourName]@gmail.com. You can plan to include your contact information in different parts of your portfolio website, like a dedicated page or across the top, bottom, or side of your portfolio website.

Color scheme. The colors in your portfolio can provide a more engaging user experience, and they should reflect your personality and personal brand. We suggest selecting a small set of colors that work well together, like one primary color and one accent color. The goal of the colors is to support your content and personal brand, not distract from it. 

You don’t need to have the content for each of these elements filled in yet. In fact, we’ll be helping you do just that through activities in this certificate program. For now, your goal is simply to have a clear understanding of the type of information that will be included in your portfolio website and start planning where you want to house each element.

Optional: Map your website’s content
A quick sketch of what your portfolio website could look like can give you a better idea of the right template to use from a website builder. All you need is a pen or pencil and paper to sketch out a basic layout of important pages. 

For example, you could start by outlining the homepage of your portfolio website and drawing where you think your name and logo, the navigation menu, and your work samples should go. Or, you could sketch an "About Me" page to visualize where you want to place an image of yourself, a description of your interests and experience, and contact information.

Don’t worry about trying to get fancy! Your goal is simply to start imagining what the layout of your website will be so that you can use templates from website builders to their full potential. Use your creative skills and have some fun!

As you map the content of your portfolio website, consider answers to these questions:

What will you include on your portfolio homepage? 

Which elements, if any, do you want to include together?

How many pages overall will you need, and what should you title each page?
