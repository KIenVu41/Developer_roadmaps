As you develop your skills in UX design and build your portfolio project, you'll need a place to showcase your work. In the field, professional UX designers often create and maintain portfolio websites, where they showcase examples of their design work. For a designer, a portfolio website is an essential tool for showing their skills, promoting their professional brand, and making connections with employers and other designers.

Thankfully, there are a number of website builder tools available to help. Website builders often have tutorials to help designers create a professional-quality site without coding. These website building sites have pre-built layouts designers can use to add text, images, and sound.

If a designer cannot or does not want to code their own website, they might use a website builder that features a so-called WYSIWYG editor. WYSIWYG, pronounced “wiz-ee-wig,” stands for “what you see is what you get.” With WYSIWYG editors, designers can add and edit text in the website builder, just as they would in a word processing program, like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. They can also easily add functionality to their sites through drag and drop components.

Here are four website builders with WYSIWYG editors:

Squarespace

Webflow

Wix

Google Sites

In this reading, you'll explore how designers set up portfolio websites and best practices for building one yourself.

The best designers typically create portfolio websites early in their careers and update them routinely as they create new work. You don’t need to create your website right now. But when you’re ready, use this reading for guidance.

Create an account with a website builder
Website builders make it easy to create a profile. If a designer opts to use one, they might create an account on 
Squarespace
,
 Webflow,
 
Wix
, or 
Google Sites
. The website builder homepages offer guidance on how to create an account and get started. For example, see:

If a designer knows how to code, they also have the option to build their own website instead of using a website builder. The choice is up to the designer!

Set up your own portfolio website
Here are some best practices that designers often follow when they create a portfolio website:

Use a portfolio template option
Each of the website builders have plenty of templates, including some templates specifically for portfolios. Templates are empty website layouts. Using a template means that a designer doesn’t have to start from a blank slate, making it much easier to set up the portfolio. For example, if a designer drafts layout ideas in advance, as you explored in the 
Plan your portfolio website
 reading, they might use those ideas to find a template with a similar appearance.

Choose the right layout option 
After a designer selects the option to use a portfolio template, each website builder presents a gallery of different portfolio layouts to choose from. A savvy designer will think about what type of portfolio they’re building and pick the best layout for their needs. 

Choose a URL name for the portfolio website
Squarespace
 requires users to pick a name before they start putting work into their portfolio, while 
Wix
 and 
Webflow
 encourage users to select a name before they publish. Either way, savvy designers typically select names that are simple and professional, like “[Your Name]design.com.”

Emulate good examples
Throughout the process of creating and building a portfolio, designers often emulate others’ work or draw on it for inspiration. Think about the portfolios you examined in the

 reading. Many designers take time to consider examples from their peers, determine what they think makes a strong portfolio, and then use those examples for inspiration.

Key takeaways
A portfolio website is an important place for designers to showcase their skills and examples of their work. With the guidelines above, you are ready to start filling out your portfolio! If you already have examples of UX design work that you want to upload to your portfolio website, feel free to add them. If not, don’t worry. You’ll create content to add to your portfolio throughout this certificate program! Your portfolio project will need 3–5 completed design projects, and you can draw on all of them for examples to include in your website.
