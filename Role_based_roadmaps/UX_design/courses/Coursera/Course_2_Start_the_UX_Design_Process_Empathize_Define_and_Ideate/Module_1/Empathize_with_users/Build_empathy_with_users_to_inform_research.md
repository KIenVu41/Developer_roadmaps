Empathy is a pillar of good UX design because it helps designers connect with users and understand their needs and problems. Indeed, empathy is so crucial to UX design that the best designers start empathizing with users long before they start formally researching their needs. For example, designers might proactively empathize with users in order to refine their research plans before they begin interviewing. This is called an empathy exercise: Designers use their imaginations and perspective-taking skills to anticipate their users’ experiences so they can ask better interview questions. 

In this review, you’ll explore an example of an exercise in which a designer empathizes with fictional user profile bios. For the purpose of this course, user profiles are short biographies that describe fictional people who stand in for real-life interview participants. Don’t confuse user profiles with user personas: User profiles are short, fictional biographies that aid with informal empathy exercises. In contrast, user personas have a more formal role in the design process: After designers interview lots of people, they distill common user characteristics into user personas, who then stand in for larger groups of similar users throughout the design process.

Before you continue, remember that you’ll have opportunities to conduct real-life interviews later in the program. For now, this review will help you understand how designers empathize with a product’s target audience before they conduct formal interviews.

Interview goals and questions
In the example we’re exploring, a designer is preparing to interview people as part of their design process for Zia’s Pizza app. You explored their 
interview plan
 earlier in the course. Here are the interview goals and questions they have planned:

Interview goals
I want to understand common challenges people face when trying to manage a busy schedule and when meal planning.

I want to identify frustrations people experience during the process of ordering from a restaurant.  

Interview questions
What is your current schedule like? How do you balance your responsibilities with meal planning?

How often do you order meals from a restaurant? When you do, what is your motivation? 

What challenges do you face in the ordering process? How do these questions make you feel?

How do you think these challenges could be resolved?

User profile: Reena
Before the designer conducts interviews, they proactively empathize with target users by focusing on fictional user profiles. Here’s one of those profiles:

Reena
Age: 37

Education:

Hometown: Lakewood, Colorado

Family: Lives mostly alone, has a teenage daughter

Occupation: Paramedic

Reena is a paramedic who lives in Lakewood, Colorado. They live alone but share custody of their daughter with their ex-partner. Reena works both day and night shifts, and their schedule changes week to week. They are a rock climber who goes to the climbing gym a few mornings a week and also drives their daughter to soccer practice any nights they’re not working. Reena has dyslexia, which makes it difficult to read text quickly and process information in fast-paced settings. Reena is health- and budget-conscious.

Pre-interview empathy exercise
Before they interview users like Reena, the designer wants to ensure they’re planning to ask the right questions. A pre-interview empathy exercise helps them anticipate participant responses and refine their questions in advance. In the example you’re about to explore, the designer imagines Reena as a real person and tries to anticipate:

How Reena might answer the interview questions

How Reena’s needs, challenges, or concerns might be addressed

As you explore the example, notice how the designer:

Uses perspective taking to imagine Reena’s opinions, experiences, and pain points

Uses bullet points and incomplete sentences to record their thoughts

Remember that the responses in the empathy exercise come from the designer themself, who is asking themself the interview questions and imagining how Reena might respond.

Refined interview questions
Designers use empathy exercises to validate their research plans, including their interview goals and questions. For example, under the Zia’s Pizza designer’s third interview question, consider the final response they imagine: “Hard to scan information, especially on a small phone screen (dyslexia). This might make Reena feel frustrated and even self-conscious about their disability.”

Having imagined this potential reaction from Reena, the designer re-evaluates the interview question that prompted it. They think through questions like these: 

What if the word “challenges” triggers some users to feel self-conscious? 

Is the word “challenging” too leading? Does this question assume that all participants will actually have experienced challenges?

How might I rephrase Question 3 to be less leading?

The designer then imagines a more neutral version of Question 3 and its follow-up: 

What is the ordering process like for you? Tell me about the experience you have with ordering and how it makes you feel.

Of course, good UX design demands that designers understand users’ challenges, so the designer doesn’t discard that term entirely. Instead, they plan to use it in a follow up question: If users like Reena bring up challenges, the designer will follow their lead and ask, “Tell me more about those challenges.”

Optional empathy exercises 
Below, you’ll find a set of fictional, sample user profiles. If you want to strengthen your empathy, consider doing empathy exercises with four profiles that you think represent the ideal users for a product you’re designing for your project portfolio. You can change some details about your selected users if you need to make them better fit the users of the product you’ll design.

You might also prefer to conduct interviews with real people at this stage. Interacting with real-life participants can give you an early look into one of the most important parts of many UX design jobs. The following websites can help you connect with research participants: 

UserTesting

User Interviews

If you choose this option, be sure to develop an interview plan according to the guidelines and best practices you explored in earlier course items, like 
Determine your research goals and questions
.

Whichever method you choose, you’re encouraged to complete four empathy exercises (or interviews).

Organize your data and envision common solutions
If you opt to do some empathy exercises or interviews, complete the process by analyzing your data and envisioning common solutions:

Analyze what you wrote for each sample user.

Identify possible commonalities across your user profiles (or interview participants). 

Consider whether there are features you can incorporate into your design that will work for a variety of users. 

Imagine that the users you just “interviewed” represent a large segment of the audience for your product. What concerns or problems seem most important to your users? What kinds of features might you build into your app to address these concerns? Be as specific or general as you need to be. (You'll learn more about UX design features in later courses, so it's okay to be vague for now.)

In the example, for instance, notice how the designer identified a favorite feature as a common solution for busy parents who use the app:

The designer wrote, “Like many working parents, Reena is clearly very busy and doesn’t have time to spend browsing for the perfect meal every day. They have favorites they like to order frequently, so having a system in the app where users can ‘favorite’ certain restaurants and then find them easily later, would be useful.”

Key takeaways
Pre-interview empathy exercises are a great way to imagine users’ responses to interview questions, envision common solutions to users’ possible needs, and identify opportunities to refine your questions for actual interviews. In UX design, remember that empathy starts before and continues after your interviews with users. It’s a crucial tool for refining and executing your approach to every phase of the design process, including user interviews.
