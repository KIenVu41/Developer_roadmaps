You’ve explored the important role that empathy and user interviews play in UX design. You’ve also explored some best practices for recruiting and interviewing users. When planning for interviews, designers often:

Create research goals to guide the interview questions they ask and the design decisions they make based on users’ responses 

Determine the target audience for the product they’re designing for and list key characteristics of the users they want to interview

Write a list of interview questions so they can determine effective questions in advance and ensure consistency across interviews with different users

Now you’ll review an example of this process in action. User interviews require input, collaboration, and time, and you won’t be asked to interview real-life participants until later in this course. For now, this review will help you get comfortable with defining the scope of UX research and understanding potential users of your products. This foundational work will help you when you’re ready to interview users later and when you’re doing UX research on the job. 


Review the example
This example comes from a UX research plan for a food delivery app called Zia's Pizza.

Interview goals: 

I want to understand common challenges people face when trying to manage a busy schedule and when meal planning.

I want to identify frustrations people experience during the process of ordering from a restaurant.  

Target participant characteristics:

Ages 18–62

Live in metropolitan or suburban areas

People who order food from restaurants at least once a week

Include participants of different genders

Include participants with disabilities

Interview questions: 

What is your current schedule like? How do you balance your responsibilities with meal planning?

How often do you order meals from a restaurant? When you do, what is your motivation? 

What challenges do you face in the ordering process? How do these challenges make you feel?

How do you think these challenges could be resolved?



Consider the research goals
Research goals guide the interview process and shape subsequent design decisions, so they need to be clear and focused on the problem the designers are trying to solve.

To craft such goals, effective designers often start by considering empathetic questions like these:

Who are my users and what problems or needs is my product aiming to solve?

What about my users do I want to learn from the interviews? 

Are there certain user problems or pain points I need to learn more about?

These kinds of user-focused questions help designers connect with users and create effective research goals, such as:

I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.

I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.

I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing.

In the example, notice how the designer defines interview goals that are both clear and specific to the Zia’s Pizza app:

I want to understand common challenges people face when trying to manage a busy schedule and when meal planning.

I want to identify frustrations people experience during the process of ordering from a restaurant.  

If the designer can understand these challenges and frustrations, they will be better able to create an effective app, one that creates an easy, meaningful, and enjoyable experience for their target users.

Consider the participant characteristics
When recruiting and choosing participants to interview, effective designers aim for a representative sample of their target users. To get the best data, it’s important to include a group that’s manageable to interview while also being diverse enough to represent the product’s real-world audience. To define this kind of group, designers often start by considering questions like these:

Who are my end users and what are their key characteristics? Key characteristics include things like age, location, career, gender, disability, and so on.

How might these characteristics shape users’ experiences with or feelings about my product or similar products?

For the Zia’s Pizza app, the ideal interview participants represent the app’s end users. They:

Are aged 18–62

Live in metropolitan or suburban areas

Order food from restaurants at least once a week

Include people of different genders 

Include people with disabilities

By defining these participant characteristics, the designer can recruit the right people to interview and also create more relevant interview questions. Remember that a product’s end users will often be identified in a project’s business requirements. If they’re not, designers typically discover their end users by conducting preliminary user research and consulting with their clients or other business stakeholders.

Consider the interview questions
Effective interview questions have five characteristics. They are: relevant, open-ended, clear, neutral, and designed for follow-up. Before you explore these characteristics in detail, consider the example interview questions again: 

What is your current schedule like? How do you balance your responsibilities with meal planning?

How often do you order meals from a restaurant? When you do, what is your motivation? 

What challenges do you face in the ordering process? How do these challenges make you feel?

How do you think these challenges could be resolved?

These example questions are relevant because they align with the problem the designer is trying to solve. They are designed to gather information about the experiences, needs, or pain points that users may have with the product or with similar products. 

The example questions are open-ended in that they invite participants to share freely and elaborate. None can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” Unless a designer needs a definitive “yes” or “no” answer to a particular question, open-ended questions will almost always generate richer and deeper information about users’ experiences.

The questions are also neutral, which means they are not designed to lead or pressure participants toward a desired response. For comparison, consider this leading, non-neutral question: “When you order meals from a restaurant, is it because you don’t have time to cook or because you don’t want to cook?” This question makes assumptions about users’ motivations and leads them into specific kinds of answers. In contrast, neutral questions will invite participants to share without assuming, anticipating, or directing their responses.

And notice how short and simple the questions are. They will be easy for interview participants to understand and answer because they are conversational and straightforward. 

Finally, notice how the questions are designed for follow-up. Questions 1–3 all have two parts. The interviewer might start with the first part and then prompt participants to elaborate with the second part. During the empathize phase of the design process, interviews should be conversational, so encouraging participants to elaborate is a best practice.  Effective designers often follow up with simple prompts like“Tell me more about that” or with classic “Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How” questions. 

Key takeaways
Research goals, participant characteristics, and interview questions are the foundation for conducting effective interviews, empathizing with users, and getting useful information about their needs, problems, and experiences. Effective designers take time to prepare thoughtful interview plans that align with their design project’s goals and their users’ needs. They also adjust their questions as their projects progress—as they work through different parts of the design process and need different kinds of information from users. When you craft interview plans for your portfolio project, revisit this review for guidance.
