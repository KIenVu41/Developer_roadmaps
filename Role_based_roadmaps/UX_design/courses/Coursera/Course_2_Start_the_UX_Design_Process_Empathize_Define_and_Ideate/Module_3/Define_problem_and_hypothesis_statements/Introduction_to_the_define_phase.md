You’ve explored how to interview and empathize with users, identify their pain points, and create user personas to guide user-centered design decisions. You’ve also explored how to synthesize your empathy work into user stories and user journey maps. User stories and journey maps are important bridges between the empathize phase and the define phase of the Design Thinking process. 

Process flow that represents the Design Thinking frameworkProcess flow that represents the Design Thinking framework: 1. Empathize, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, and 5. Test. Define is highlighted.
As designers move into the define phase, they will use their empathy work to answer these key questions: 

Which of my users’ needs or problems are the most important ones for my design to address? 

How might my design address these needs or problems in effective and unique ways that create value for users?

Now you’ll explore how designers build on their user stories and user journey maps to identify specific user problems and hypothesize solutions.

Problem statements
With user stories and user journey maps in front of them, a designer can better identify the user needs their design must address. This is where problem statements come in: A problem statement summarizes who the user is, what they need from a design, and why. Here’s a simple template:

[Name of user persona] is a [type of user] who needs [type of user experience] because [benefits of user experience].

For example, here’s the problem statement that the bakery’s designer created for Berta:

Berta is an older person with a visual impairment. She is a long-time bakery customer who prefers ordering over the phone. She needs a website and online ordering system that are easy to use, adapt to her vision needs, and mimic the feel and flow of a friendly phone conversation. She wants to place her orders with ease and feel like she’s making a personal connection with the bakery.

Hypothesis statements
Hypothesis statements help designers move from defining problems toward ideating solutions. In crafting a hypothesis statement, the designer makes an educated guess about what might be the best solution to the problem they identified in their problem statement. Hypothesis statements can take many forms, but they often follow a classic if/then formula:

If [user] can perform [action], then they will achieve [benefit].

For example, the bakery’s website designer might build on Berta’s problem statement to create a hypothesis like this:

If Berta can place online orders in a simple system that mimics the feel and flow of a friendly phone conversation, she will continue to feel a connection with the bakery.

Value propositions
At their best, value propositions are short, compelling statements about how a designer’s product addresses users’ needs and creates unique value for users. Value propositions can summarize and synthesize the user benefits from multiple hypothesis statements.

To create a value proposition, designers typically answer these key questions:

What does the product do? Here, designers clearly state the key actions the product enables users to perform or the key benefits it enables them to achieve.

Why should the user care? Here, designers emphasize how their product addresses users’ pain points in unique ways that aren’t offered by other products.

In the bakery example we’ve been exploring, the designer might create a value proposition like this one:

The bakery’s new website offers a streamlined online ordering system that mimics the feel and flow of a friendly phone conversation. This system is easy to use and enables the bakery’s customer base to order online while maintaining a valuable feeling of personal connection with the bakery staff.

Key takeaways
In the define phase of Design Thinking, designers build on their empathy work to identify specific user problems and hypothesize possible solutions. These problems and solutions should emerge from a rich understanding of who users are and how they experience the product, including the specific tasks they encounter and the feelings they bring to those tasks. 

By developing concise and compelling problem statements, hypothesis statements, and value propositions, designers are in a better position to start ideating solutions that will actually meet users’ needs. They’re also in a better position to convince stakeholders by showing how their solutions align with real users’ experiences and address real users’ pain points.
