You’ve spent a lot of time learning about the users you're designing for, and how empathy and user research can improve your understanding of users' needs. As a reminder, here's where you're at in the design process:

Empathizing with users allows you to consider the product experience from the users’ perspective. By connecting with people directly, like through interviews, you can discover and understand users' likes, dislikes, and pain points. 

Then, sort through research you collected about users to define the problem they're facing. Creating a problem statement helps you clearly define the user pain points that your future designs can address. 

Now, you can begin coming up with solutions that address those problems! You’re ready to create hypothesis statements. A hypothesis statement is an educated guess about what you think the solution to a design problem might be. You know the challenges users are facing, so it’s time to consider how your designs can alleviate their pain points. 

Hypothesis statements don’t have a single standard formula to follow, but there are two common methods you can try using to write one. 

First, you can use the if / then format to come up with a hypothesis statement. Here are examples of if/then hypothesis statements applied to the users of the dog walker app:

If Arnold downloads the dog walker app, then they can utilize the “simplified” mode setting to view only the basic app functions. 

If Tobias signs up for the dog walker app, then they will quickly and easily pick a walker that fits their schedule.

Second, you can use the we believe format to come up with a hypothesis statement. Here are examples of we believe hypothesis statements applied to the dog walker app:

We believe that a simplified mode of the dog walker app for Arnold will allow them to hire dog walkers efficiently.

We believe that easy access to available dog walkers for Tobias will increase the amount of walks they choose for their pets. 

If / then statements focus directly on the needs of users. On the other hand, we believe statements take the perspective of your team into account, while remaining empathetic to the needs of users.

You might encounter situations where you have multiple hypothesis statements for one problem statement. That’s okay! There will always be multiple solutions for the problems that users are facing. Your job as a UX designer is to use your creativity and problem-solving skills to decide which solutions work best for the unique users you’re designing for.

Hypothesis statements help you narrow down your research insights into goals for your product, so you can stay focused on the wants and needs of your users.
