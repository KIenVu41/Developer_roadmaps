This review will guide you through saving design elements in Figma for future use by creating a working sticker sheet, also known as a design kit, for your mockups. A sticker sheet should list all of the most-used components and elements in your design thus far. For example, your sticker sheet could include the following UI items:

Components: Reusable UI components such as buttons, menus, and cards

Typography: Typographic elements, including fonts and font families

Color: Color choices, including an overall palette and specific component colors

Iconography: Icons representing recurring actions or navigation choices a user might interact with

We’ll get to know this process by following a designer as they create a sticker sheet in Figma for the Zia’a Pizza app. When you’re ready to create your own sticker sheets, you can refer to this as a guide.

In order to help keep things organized in the project file, designers separate different parts of a project into different pages.

Note: Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for

. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being. 

To create a new page:

Navigate to the Pages section of Figma towards the top-left corner of the screen. 

Click on the + button. 

Name the new page “Sticker Sheet” by typing the name and either hitting enter or clicking off of the text-entry field.

Create a new frame

New frames act as a canvas for sticker sheets. So, to get started, the designer created a new frame. 

To create a new frame:

Select Frame from the toolbar near the top-left corner of the screen or use the keyboard shortcut F (on Mac and PC). 

Select the frame labeled Desktop. This allows for plenty of room to create the sticker sheet. 

Identify UI elements to include in the sticker sheet
At this point in the design process, the designer has already established design elements such as fonts, color, and buttons that can now be added to a sticker sheet. 

In the example below, the designer added the logos and buttons by simply copying the element on the artboard and pasting it into the sticker sheet frame that was just created.

Next, the designer added the project colors to the sheet. To add colors to the sticker sheet, the designer first created some new shapes in the frame. 

To create a shape: 

Select Shape Tools from the toolbar in the top-left corner of the screen. 

Select the shape from the drop-down.

From here, the designer created three squares in the sticker sheet frame.

Then, the designer found the colors to add by copying the HEX codes—the combination of letters and numbers that define a color’s RGB (red, green, blue) value. To find a HEX code, select the element with the desired color, and the code will be in the fill section of the design tab in the right sidebar.

With the HEX code copied, the designer went back to the sticker sheet, selected a shape, and pasted the new HEX code into the fill section.

Using this method, the designer created and saved a full color palette on their sticker sheet! 


Arrange UI elements onto the sticker sheet
Once the UI elements to include in the sticker sheet are identified, it is time to begin arranging them. 

The designer started by choosing a font (as a reminder from earlier assignments, you can find the font selection menu in the design tab in the right side panel) to use as a heading for the items in the sticker sheet.

To avoid confusion, the designer chose a font that is different from the fonts being used in the design. A standard typeface like Helvetica, Roboto, or Arial works well, for example. Using one of these typefaces makes it easier for a viewer to differentiate between a category label on your sticker sheet as opposed to a UI element from your project.

Next, the designer began arranging items in the sticker sheet by category—keeping all the buttons together, all the icons together, etc. It is important to keep an eye on the spacing between elements in the sticker sheet. Using a grid can help keep things aligned. Without keeping the spacing in line, things can begin to appear messy pretty fast. 

The example below is a finished sticker sheet.

Key takeaways
The example identifies similar types of UI elements that are categorized and grouped together: colors, typography, buttons, etc. Where there are multiple variants of an item (like an active or inactive button), both versions are included. Finally, the example labels all the individual elements that have a specific use, like the Heading 1 font as opposed to the button font. 

When you’re ready, you can use this as a guide to create your own sticker sheet and compare it to the example above.
