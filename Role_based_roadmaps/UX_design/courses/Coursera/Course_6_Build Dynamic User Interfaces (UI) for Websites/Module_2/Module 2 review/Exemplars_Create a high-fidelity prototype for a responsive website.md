 In this reading, you will review three completed exemplars of high-fidelity prototypes for responsive websites based on the three prompts that you’ve been following throughout this certificate: 

Design an app and a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner.

Design an app and a progressive website that help residents of a large city, with over 100 parks, to reserve and pay the rental fee for an outdoor pavilion for an event.

Create an app and a responsive website that allow a local business to monitor their inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information.

These exemplars range in complexity and are completed versions of the activity you completed in 
Self-review: Create a high-fidelity prototype for a responsive website
. You can compare your own work to these examples which meet all the criteria required for a high-fidelity prototype. There’s also a short explanation of how each exemplar meets the requirements for a high-fidelity prototype. 

MediMatch Connect
This first example is the simplest version and includes mockups and a high-fidelity prototype of the MediMatch Connect website. In this example, there are two responsive versions of the homepage. A user searches for medical practitioners in their area, and then can compare, select, and contact results to find the practitioner that best fits their needs. 

Desktop homepage mockup
Below is an example of the desktop version of mockups for the MediMatch Connect website homepage:

As you can see in this exemplar, users can easily navigate from the homepage, where they can search for a healthcare practitioner, to a results page with a list of relevant healthcare practitioners. Users can then select a doctor, go to the doctor’s profile page, and open up the “contact the specialist” window. Closing the contact window will return the user to the profile page for the selected practitioner. When the prototype runs, selectable items are highlighted in blue, and the cursor changes from an arrow to a hand indicating that an element can be selected. This exemplar demonstrates the benefits of creating a prototype for an app or a responsive website on which users can easily search for and contact a healthcare practitioner. It illustrates a simple user flow with logical navigation and accessible features.  

Fairweather Pavilion Rentals
This second example includes mockups and a high-fidelity prototype of the Fairweather Pavilion Rental website. In this example, there are two responsive versions of the homepage. A user searches for outdoor pavilions available in the city park system, then they can reserve and pay the rental fee for whichever one best fits their needs for their event.

The Fairweather Pavilion Rentals website has four mockup screens for both desktop and mobile, between which the user is able to navigate: 

A homepage with featured pavilions; a list of pavilions which can be filtered by location, price, and capacity; and the steps for reserving a pavilion for an event

A details page for the selected pavilion listing its location, price, capacity, a short description, images, and a “Book Now” button

A booking page showing a calendar with available reservation dates, reservation times (beginning and ending times), the pavilion’s details, a Back button, and a Continue to payment button

A payment information page listing the price of renting the selected pavilion, any taxes or fees, the total reservation amount, and a form to fill out your payment information; also, a Go Back button and a Finalize your Payment button

In this prototype example, the user can search for available pavilions that fit their needs for an event, and they can then reserve and book the pavilion online from anywhere, at any time. This is a great solution for users who are looking for outdoor event spaces but don’t know where to start, what’s available in their area, or how much it costs to reserve a pavilion for an event. It reduces the time that users have to spend online researching and streamlines the booking process. 

Go>>Fresh
This third and final example includes more mockups and a more complex, high-fidelity prototype of the Go>>Fresh inventory website. In this example, there are two responsive versions of the homepage. A user can monitor their inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information. 

Desktop dashboard mockup

In this prototype example, the user can easily access their inventory to track sales and available stock, review statistics relating to spending and sales, and reach out to suppliers for orders. It stores all this information in a single location, so the user doesn’t have to search for hardcopies of documents or perform tasks related to inventory management manually. 

Key takeaways
All of the example prototypes presented here are complete exemplars ranging in complexity. You can compare your high-fidelity prototypes to these exemplars whenever you’re ready.  As you compare, ask yourself:

Do my prototypes have:

At least four mockup screens connected in a simulated navigational flow?

The ability for users to proceed forward and backward within the flow?

The ability for users to enter the flow from different starting points?

Clear navigation cues?

An indication of successful completion of the simulated activity?

The ability for users to return to the screen they started on?

Placeholder items that have been replaced with high-fidelity assets?

Accessibility considerations for inclusive design?

At least two versions of one screen in different sizes—one small version for mobile and one large version for desktop—for responsive design?
