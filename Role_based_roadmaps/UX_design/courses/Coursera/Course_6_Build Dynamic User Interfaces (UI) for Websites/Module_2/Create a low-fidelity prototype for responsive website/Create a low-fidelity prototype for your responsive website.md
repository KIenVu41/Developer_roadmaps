In this reading, you will review three completed exemplars of low-fidelity prototypes for  responsive websites based on the three prompts that you’ve been following throughout this certificate program: 

Design an app and a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner.

Design an app and a progressive website that help residents of a large city, with over 100 parks, to reserve and pay the rental fee for an outdoor pavilion for an event.

Create an app and a responsive website that allow a local business to monitor its inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information.

These exemplars range in complexity and are completed versions of the activity you completed in 
Create a low-fidelity prototype for your responsive website
. You can compare your own work to these examples, which meet all the criteria required for a low-fidelity prototype. There’s also a short explanation of how each exemplar meets the requirements for a low-fidelity prototype for a responsive website. 

MediMatch Connect

In this low-fidelity prototype exemplar, the user can search for a healthcare practitioner, select one that meets their medical needs, and contact the medical practitioner to make an appointment. Users can complete a task or user flow, move forward and backward, and navigate with the cues included. In this example, this prototype is testing the main user flow of searching for a healthcare practitioner, viewing the healthcare practitioner’s profile for additional details, and contacting the healthcare practitioner.

Fairweather Pavilion Rentals

.

In this low-fidelity prototype exemplar, the user can search for available pavilions that fit their needs for an event, and they can then reserve and book the pavilion online from anywhere, at any time. Users can complete a task or user flow, move forward and backward, and navigate with the cues included. In this example, this prototype is testing the main user flow of searching for an available pavilion to rent, selecting an option that works best for the user's needs, selecting an available date to book, and completing the reservation by paying the rental fee.

Go>>Fresh 
Low-fidelity prototype demonstrating the navigation of the Go>>Fresh responsive website.

.

In this low-fidelity prototype exemplar, the user can access their inventory to track sales and available stock, review statistics relating to spending and sales, and reach out to suppliers for orders. Users can also add items or view item details. Users can complete a task or user flow, move forward and backward, and navigate with the cues included. Remember that a prototype is always built around testing the user flow that solves the user problem. In this example, this prototype is testing the main user flow of monitoring and managing inventory.

Key takeaways
All of the example prototypes presented here are complete exemplars ranging in complexity. You can compare your low-fidelity prototypes to these exemplars whenever you’re ready. As you compare, ask yourself:

Does your prototype:

Connect at least four distinct wireframes, allowing the completion of a main user flow?

Include connections that allow users to proceed forward and backward within the sequence?

Include clear navigation cues?

Display messaging or navigational cues that indicate the successful completion of the simulated user flow?

Include a means for users to return to the starting point after successfully completing the flow sequence?

If any of your answers are no, return to

 and make adjustments to your prototypes. You can use the three exemplars provided in this reading as a reference when creating your own prototypes.
