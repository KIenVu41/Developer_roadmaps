Low-Fidelity Prototypes: A Refresher

Low-fidelity prototypes are basic representations of a product's design, showing the layout and functionality without detailed visuals.
They are used for early-stage testing to see how users interact with the core design concepts.
Distinguishing Prototypes from Wireframes

While both are simplified versions of a design, wireframes act as blueprints, focusing on structure and layout.
Prototypes, on the other hand, connect these wireframes and incorporate interactive elements to test user flows and identify usability issues early on.
Purpose of Prototype Testing

The goal is to uncover any problems in the website's functionality and navigation through user testing.
By gathering feedback early, designers can refine the design before moving on to higher-fidelity prototypes and development.
