This review provides an example of how to use a low-fidelity prototype to demonstrate the functionality of a responsive website. Specifically, you’ll see how a designer created a user flow and prototype for the checkout process of the online shopping store Tee’s Shirts.

If you’re taking this Certificate in order, you’ve already learned how to create a lo-fi prototype in an earlier course. If you need a refresher, you can review

Create a user flow

The designer started by thinking about the task they wanted users to complete, and asked themselves two questions:

How will users navigate through the necessary pages on the website? 

How will users go from one page to the next?

To address these questions, the designer started by building a user flow that allowed users to: 

Move forwards and backwards

Enter the flow from different starting points

Clearly understand when the desired user flow has ended

Return to the entry point after completing the simulated interaction

Open the project and select prototype mode
To accomplish their goal, the designer opened their digital wireframe project in Figma, went to the right sidebar, and clicked the Prototype tab to start creating the user interaction flow between the pages.

Decide the user entry points
The designer studied the wireframes to decide on the main user flow. Here are some questions they took into consideration when deciding on the main entry point:

What do I want my user to be able to do? 

How will my users navigate through the website structure?

Where do I want them to start their journey?

In this example from the Tee’s Shirts website, the designer wanted the user to be able to select an item and go through the checkout process; they called this a “checkout flow.”

In this example, the designer sketched an ideal user flow for purchasing an item: 

Navigate to the women’s section.

Choose a t-shirt.

Select the color and size.

Add it to the cart.

Continue to checkout.

Fill in e-mail address information.

Choose a shipping option.

Enter payment and billing information.

Click “Place order.”

Connect frames using prototype mode
The designer then connected the items in the frames to allow users to click through the pages of the website to complete the “checkout flow.” To do this, they used the following steps:

Click the Prototype tab on the right sidebar. 

Click the first item in the user flow. Once complete, a blue circular node on the right side of the item will appear.

Click and drag the blue arrow to the destination item on the other frame.

Release the mouse and notice that the blue arrow has been drawn connecting the two items.

Here’s the finished user flow. The entry point in the prototype is the homepage:

Repeat the process to complete the user flow
Working carefully and using the intended user flow as a guide, the designer created the other interactions by following the same instructions and made sure each connection worked by previewing their prototype.

To preview a prototype, click the Play icon at the top right of the screen. After the preview window appears, test out the user flow by clicking on all the buttons that were connected earlier. If the user flow isn’t correct, go back and fix the interactions. For a finished prototype, connect all the wireframes necessary to complete the main user flow. This will allow users to test the entire prototype.

Create a checklist for the interactions
Prototypes are designed to test how well users can complete specific tasks in a simulated activity, so it’s important to be specific about which types of interactions to build into the prototype. 

In this example, there are four interactions to notice:

Move forward and backward.

Enter the flow from the starting point.

Clearly understand when the desired user flow has ended.

Return to the entry point after completing the simulated interaction.

Check the prototype
Once all the connections had been made, the designer went through the entire experience to double-check everything before finalizing the prototype and showing it to their users. 

Key takeaways
When you create your own low-fidelity prototype, you can use this as a guide and compare your low-fidelity prototype to the matching example above.

As you compare, ask yourself: 

Did I remember to design in prototype mode?

Did I draw out my user flow? How many did I do?

Which entry point did I choose? Does the entry point match the example? Why do I think they are different or the same?

Which interactions did I consider for the prototype? Do they match the example? Why or why not?

Did I use wires to connect the start and destination items for each interaction?

Did I create multiple interactions for the user in the flow of the prototype?

Did I include at least four connected wireframes in a simulated navigational flow?

Is there a way for users to proceed forward and backward within the flow?

Is there a way provided for users to enter the flow from different starting points?

Are the cues for navigation clearly indicated?

Is the successful completion of the simulated activity clearly indicated?

Are users returned to an origin point after successfully completing the simulated activity?
