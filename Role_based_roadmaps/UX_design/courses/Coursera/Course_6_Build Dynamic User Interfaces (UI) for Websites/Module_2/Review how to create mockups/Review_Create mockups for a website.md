This review goes through how a designer took their low-fidelity digital wireframes and started creating mockups for the homepage of the online clothing company called Tee’s Shirts. 

As you’ve already learned, a mockup is a static, high-fidelity design that is used as a representation of a final product. Mockups help UX designers refine layouts, colors, and user interfaces with more detail than wireframes, but they require less work than high-fidelity prototypes. 

In this example, the designer starts the transition from low-fidelity to high-fidelity mockups by focusing first on the desktop version of the webpage. You will see that this process is not a straight “copy; paste and replace” of each element from the wireframes, but rather a time to continue to evolve the design by trying new arrangements and new ideas. 

Open the existing Figma wireframes
The designer started by opening the project file that contains their low-fidelity prototype. It’s a good idea to have these wireframes available when moving from low-fidelity to high-fidelity designs. 

Create a new frame for the mockup
The designer selected the Frame tool in the toolbar.

Note: Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for

. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being.

Then they chose the Desktop frame size on the right sidebar in the Design tab, and placed the new frame below the low-fidelity wireframe to use as a reference.

Note that it may be necessary to extend the frames past the above-the-fold section of the page. Above the fold refers to all of the content that appears on screen when a user accesses a website, while below the fold refers to everything else that appears on the page when a user scrolls down. Start with the preset desktop screen size of 1440px by 1024px, then click and drag the bottom of the frame downwards as needed to extend it. The average above the fold area is 800px. Therefore, it's important to prioritize the most valuable information within this space. For laptops and desktops, some other common heights include 768px, 900px, 1080px, and 1440px. These heights can cater to smaller laptop screens and larger desktop monitors. 

Other desktop screen sizes that designers use include:

1920×1080px

1366×768px

1440×900px

1536×864px

1024×768px

Use the wireframes as a reference
The designer created a duplicate of the wireframe and then proceeded to to replace the low-fidelity elements with high-fidelity ones. This duplicated wireframe served as a template, but at this stage, the designer actively looked for opportunities to enhance the design and wasn't bound strictly to the original wireframe.

Other designers may prefer to incorporate certain elements from their wireframes while creating others entirely from scratch. Whether to use the wireframe as a template or begin the mockup from a blank canvas is entirely up to the designer's choice.

No matter what method is used, mockups will look different from the wireframes. So, it's important not to focus too much on copying every detail from the wireframes. Instead, remain open and willing to explore new layouts and ideas while placing the design elements. Embrace the opportunity to iterate and enhance the design during the mockup stage.

Place design elements
Once the designer had their frame in place, they added the elements of their design to the new frame, starting at the top of the page. Some designers like to start from the top of the page and work down, while others like to start at the bottom and work up. It’s up to each designer to decide which method works best.

The designer for Tee’s Shirts followed the structure created from their wireframe as a guide by placing elements such as a navigation bar, text frames, and buttons using the Shape tool in the toolbar. Once elements were placed and sized, the designer could change the colors using hex values or by adjusting them in the color wheel.

Keep in mind when you’re creating your mockups, you may have ideas that differ from the low-fidelity (lo-fi) designs you created, so feel free to try new solutions, arrangements, and placements as you see fit. Things that weren’t apparent in your low-fi iterations might become more noticeable as you move to hi-fi. This is your place to experiment with those arrangements and see what works best for your final designs. 

Add images and logos
Next, the designer included any images or logos that will appear above the fold on the homepage. A hero image often appears at the top of website homepage pages. You can use open-source stock images or images you have permissions to use. 

The designer placed their chosen images, using the Rectangle tool by first creating a rectangle to match the desired size in the design and then placing or dragging the image into the rectangle. The image will automatically fill the rectangle. From here, the image can be moved and adjusted if necessary. The designer then repeated this process for any other images that appear above the fold on the homepage. 

Images added above the fold

Add text
Next, the designer added text to the appropriate places, sticking to a limited number of fonts. 

They included a website title, button names, and content section headers. Adjustments were made to the text in the panel on the right side of the screen considering things like font, size, color, and more. They made sure to use typographic hierarchy when deciding the placement and size of their text. 

Because the content of a website is not usually written by a designer, placeholder text like lorem ipsum can be used as placeholder for larger sections of text that don’t affect navigation. 

Use styles and components for consistency and time savings
Using style and component features in Figma is a great way to save time and make your mockups easy to update and simple for other designers to access. 

Save styles for colors, text, and effects
The designer saved styles for any colors, text styles, and effects that will be used more than once in the website. 

You can save styles for text, colors, and effects in the Design tab on the right sidebar. To save a color style, select the design element with the color you want to save, and click the four squares icon to the right of the Fill section. Click the plus sign to add and name the color. To save text styles, repeat the same process while selecting the text. The same process can be done for Strokes and Effects. 

Save components for buttons, icons, and more
Components are elements you can reuse across your designs for grouped elements like buttons, icons, and layouts. To create a single component, select the layers to include in the component, and click Create component in the toolbar.

Once a component is created, it can be easily accessed from the Assets panel and placed anywhere in the document. An instance is a copy of the component a designer can reuse in the designs. Instances are linked to the main component and receive any updates made to the component.

Continue adding elements
The designer added the rest of the elements below the fold to complete the homepage by doing the following:

Used the rectangle and ellipse tools to draw the containers to add icons and images, dragged the image files into them, and then resized and placed them in the proper places 

Created the icons and interactive elements using the rectangle and ellipse tools

A section highlighting best-sellers with four individual products for sale, including images in squares and text descriptions. At the bottom is a footer with company information.
Create mockups for the remaining pages of the website
Once finished with the mockup of the website’s homepage, the designer continued to create mockups for the remaining pages until the entire website design was represented. 

As a recap, the designer followed these steps to complete the rest of the mockups:

Create a new frame.

Place the elements on each page in their design. 

Use the components they created for their homepage for all repeated elements. 

Create any remaining elements using the rectangle, ellipse, and line tools. 

Add content boxes, borders and frames to each page. 

Add text on each page using styles with the corresponding fonts, placements, and text sizes to maintain continuity throughout the pages of the design. 

Place images inside of ellipses and rectangles, then resize and place the image in the desired space.

Key takeaways
You can use this review as a guide to help you create mockups for your portfolio project. When comparing your mockups to the example above, ask yourself: 

Did I use my homepage wireframe as a reference for my mockup?

Did I create an appropriately sized frame? 

Did I place and edit elements using the shape tool?

Did I include images?

Did I add or create icons?

Did I add text? 

Did I save recurring parts of my design as styles and components? 

Did I repeat the mockup process for the remaining pages of my website?
