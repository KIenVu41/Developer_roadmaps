You’ve learned how to modify the designs of websites in Figma to achieve a responsive web design, which allows a website to change automatically depending on the size of the device. Now, you’ll review how the designer for Tee’s Shirts achieved a responsive website design by adapting the desktop version of their mockups to a mobile version.

Note: Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for

. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being. 

Open the file containing the desktop version of the mockups
The designer opened the project file that has the desktop version of the Tee’s Shirts mockups and copied and pasted the mockups into a new project. They renamed the file Mockups_Mobile.

Then, they created a new frame and chose from the preset frame sizes in the Frame section of the Design tab on the right side of the Figma window. The dimensions can also be modified manually by clicking on a frame and changing the dimensions manually.

Use the mobile version wireframes as a guide
The designer then used the layout from their wireframes as a guide for the mobile version of their website. Using the original wireframes helps correctly adapt the layout of the homepage. It was helpful for this designer to refer back to the desktop mockup of their homepage to remember important layout considerations. In your designs, consider doing the same. Remember that things will probably change at this point. As a designer moves into higher-fidelity designs, it is common to find new ways to improve the designs. It's okay to adjust, change, and move things around based on what you've learned or noticed.

Begin modifying the layout and placing elements on the homepage
At this stage, the designer was ready to start adding any above-the-fold elements of the design to the new frame. The designer evaluated what is essential to the functionality of the design and identified what can be removed to maximize effectiveness on the smaller screen size. The mobile version is narrower, so they decided to add the main logo and a new hamburger menu. 

Adapt the navigation bar
The best way to adapt the navigation bar for the mobile version is moving some of the elements to other places because of the limited space on the narrow screen.

Here are the steps the designer took to adapt the navigation bar:

Create a new frame in Figma by clicking the F key.

Choose the desired mobile screen size in the Design tab under Frame.

Name the frame “Flyout.” This separate frame will contain the flyout menu, a menu which “flies out” from the side of the screen when a user hovers a mouse over, or clicks on, an element. This flyout menu links to a hamburger menu, a menu icon on the navigation bar that holds some of the icons that won’t fit into a more narrow page.

Create the hamburger menu. Draw a rectangle by using the rectangle tool on the upper-left toolbar, and then scale it down to fit the navigation bar. Duplicate the rectangle two times, and then group the rectangles together. Fill in the bars with color in the fill menu on the lower right. 

Drop the icons into the flyout menu and arrange them in order. Make sure to include the main logo as well. 

Draw a fill color inside of a rectangle that is later used as the background for the flyout menu.

Create a close button, which allows users to close the flyout when it appears over the hamburger menu. To do this, draw two rectangles just above the hamburger menu, then group and rotate them. 

The designer added the interaction between the hamburger menu and flyout later, in the high-fidelity prototype. You can repeat this same technique for other space-saving layout changes. For example, you might add a pop-up menu that appears when users hit the search button.

Resize the hero images and grouped elements
Next, the designer scaled down the hero image, the main image on the above the fold section of the homepage, that stretches from the left to right of the screen. Then, they scaled down and shifted the lockups: single interactive elements that contain text and image(s) grouped together.

Modify the footer
Then, using the mobile version of the digital wireframes, the designer adapted the layout of the elements and components in the footer by scaling them down and realigning them.

Below the product section is a footer with sections for company information, locations, and contact information.
Save reusable styles and components
While working, the designer was sure to save styles for the colors, text, and effects in the design tab on the right. They also saved components like the flyout menu into the assets panel on the left. 

Key takeaways
Consider comparing the examples provided to your own work. As you assess your work, here are some guiding questions you can use. Did you:

Copy and paste the desktop version of your mockups and save the file to get started?

Use the mobile version of your digital wireframes as a guide?

Create a flyout menu and relocate the navigation bar items there?

Create a hamburger menu and close button?

Resize and shift the hero image and lockouts on the page?

Resize and shift the content in the footer?

Save all the new color, text styles, and components into the assets panel?
