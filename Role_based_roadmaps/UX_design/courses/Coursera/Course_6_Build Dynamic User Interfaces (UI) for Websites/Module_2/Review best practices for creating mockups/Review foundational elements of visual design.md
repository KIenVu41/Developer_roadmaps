This is a very exciting part of the course because you’re about to design mockups for your responsive website. This is when your designs will start to look like a real product! 

As you begin to design mockups, remember the importance of the foundational elements of visual design. On a basic level, the term visual design in UX refers to how a product or technology appears to the user. If you’ve been taking the courses of the certificate program in order, in the last course, you learned about three foundational elements of visual design: typography, color, and iconography.

We won’t cover these foundational elements in this course because we assume that you learned about them in the previous course. If you need a refresher, check out this video that

After that, you can revisit videos and readings that detail each of the three foundational elements of visual design that were covered, including:

Typography is the practice of arranging text and typefaces, also known as fonts, to make language legible, readable, and visually appealing. Typography can help add hierarchy to your designs, make text easy to read, and add visual style. For more information, review this video about

Color is one of the most impactful visual design elements. As you design, think about the messages or emotions that certain colors communicate, how people understand color, and how colors mix, match, or contrast with one another. For example, red attracts a lot of attention, while blue communicates serenity, calmness, and peace. To learn more about color, review this video about

, and this reading about 
accessibility considerations for using color in design
. 

Iconography refers to the images or symbols associated with a subject or idea. Think of the icon for power on your computer - it’s probably a circle with a line, but most people know that this icon means power! When created effectively, icons limit wasted text space, catch the user's attention, and are an easy way to transition to another page or location.
