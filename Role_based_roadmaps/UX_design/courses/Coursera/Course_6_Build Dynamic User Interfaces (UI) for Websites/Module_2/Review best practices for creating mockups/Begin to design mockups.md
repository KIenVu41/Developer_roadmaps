Wireframes: Blueprints of Design

Wireframes are like blueprints, providing a basic structure of a website or app's layout and content hierarchy.
They can be created on paper for brainstorming or digitally for more refined layouts.
Mockups: Bringing Designs to Life

Mockups transform wireframes into static, high-fidelity designs, incorporating colors, typography, and images.
They help visualize the final product's look and feel, aiding in user flow mapping and design iteration.
From Wireframes to Mockups: An Evolutionary Process

Transitioning from wireframes to mockups allows for design exploration and refinement, experimenting with element placement for aesthetics and user interaction.
Iterative feedback on mockups is crucial for improving the design and ensuring a user-centered approach.
