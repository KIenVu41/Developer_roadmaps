Web Accessibility

Web accessibility ensures that websites are usable by people with disabilities, and UX designers play a crucial role in incorporating accessibility considerations.
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide standards for making web content accessible, focusing on text, sounds, and images.
UX Design Techniques for Accessibility

Annotations help engineers understand the intended order for assistive technologies to navigate through interactive elements.
Hierarchical headings, tagged with H1, H2, etc., improve navigation for screen reader users and visually convey page structure.
Importance of Labels

Labels provide descriptive text for interactive elements, improving usability for people using screen readers.
Grouping similar controls, like checkboxes, enhances comprehension and navigation for assistive technology users.
