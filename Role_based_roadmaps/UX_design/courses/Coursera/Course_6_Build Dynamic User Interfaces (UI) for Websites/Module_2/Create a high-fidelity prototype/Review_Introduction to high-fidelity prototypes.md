High-Fidelity Prototypes: Bridging Design & Functionality

High-fidelity prototypes are detailed, interactive versions of your designs that use real content and accurately reflect the final product's look and feel.
Unlike mockups that focus on visual aspects, high-fidelity prototypes prioritize functionality, allowing users to experience the product's flow and interactions.
Key Elements of High-Fidelity Prototypes

Visual Elements: Replace placeholders with actual content, including realistic text, images, icons, and typography.
Navigation: Ensure smooth user flow by incorporating clear navigation elements like buttons, icons, and back arrows, allowing users to move between screens effortlessly.
Interactivity: Implement interactive elements, such as gestures and motion, to simulate real-world user interactions with the product.
