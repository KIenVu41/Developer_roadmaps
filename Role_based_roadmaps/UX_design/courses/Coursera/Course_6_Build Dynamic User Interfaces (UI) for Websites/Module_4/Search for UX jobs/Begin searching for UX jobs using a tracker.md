Introduction
So far, you’ve learned about common UX designer jobs and the types of companies that may hire UX designers. Now it’s time to learn how to search for UX design jobs. It can seem daunting at first. Let’s start with how to tailor your resume to the jobs you’re interested in.

Find a job listing you’re interested in
Use 
Google Search
 or another resource like
 Indeed
 or 
Linkedin
 for your search, and select at least one job description. 

Create your own key word document or use a template 
Once you’ve decided on a job posting you’d like to pursue, create a two-columned table to help you identify keywords from the job description. These keywords will help you tailor your resume to the specific job description. If you don’t want to create your own document, you can use a 
template.

Populate the table
Now, you’ll start to populate the table. Fill in the first column of the table with the requirements from the job description. Remember, these requirements describe the expectations for the person who lands the position. Be sure to copy and paste the job link into this column as well. This will allow you to easily return to the listing when you’re ready to apply. 

Here is an example of what this might look like:

A two-columned table with the left-side column showing a link to a sample job posting.Under the job posting, sample job requirements are listed. The right column is blank.
Highlight and add keywords to the table
Next, you’ll highlight the keywords in the list of requirements. The keywords should be related to the skills, tools, experience, or goals you would need for this job. Once you’ve identified these keywords, copy and paste them into the second column. This list will make it easy for you to quickly scan what skills, words, or phrases you should use to reinforce your resume.

Here is an example of what this might look like:

A two-columned table with the left-side column showing a link to a sample job posting.Under the job posting, sample job requirements are listed. Keywords are highlighted. The right column shows keywords that are highlighted. Those words are listed as: mobile app prototyping, user flows, user research, and ideate.
Use the keywords to update your resume 
Now, you can use the keyword list to tailor your resume to each specific job. You’ll simply add these words into your resume descriptions or include them in newly created descriptions. Keep in mind, your resume should only include the skills you have. It’s okay if you can’t do everything in the job description. Recruiters or hiring managers will see you’re a good fit for the job if your resume aligns with the job description. 

Reflect on the keywords table
As you find job postings you’d like to pursue, use this table, or something similar, to identify keywords that you can use to tailor your resume. Ask yourself:  

Have I identified the right keywords in the job description?

Did I use those keywords in my resume to address how I’ve met the job requirements? 

Keep your job search organized
Now that you’ve identified a job posting you’d like to pursue, identified keywords from the posting, and tailored your resume accordingly, it’s time to organize your job search. A job tracker can help you stay organized. Let’s learn more.

What is a job tracker? 
A job tracker is a document—likely a spreadsheet—that will help you stay organized and keep track of the jobs you’ve applied to. You’ll include the criteria that are most important for your job hunt. These may include information such as: 

The company’s name

Location or commute

A link to the company website

A point of contact, notes or outreach

The type of company

Additional notes that may help you distinguish the company or job from others

Create your own job tracker or use a template
You can create your own spreadsheet or you can use the 
job tracker template
 as your starting point. In either case, personalize your job tracker and make it most useful for you. Boldface text, fills, and colors are ways to do this. These treatments may help you identify important categories and items.

Review a sample job tracker
Review the sample job tracker. This tracker has been completed and is filled in. It includes basic information such as the company name, location, website, type of company, and job posting type. It is also important to note who you talked to (the recruiter or contact), any notes you may want to include to jog your memory, and any requirements (need-to-haves) that you’d like, or wishlist items (nice-to-haves). Finally, it is helpful to note the application status and where you are in the process.
