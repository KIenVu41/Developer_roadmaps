When you’re searching for a new job, it can be challenging to know where to start — especially if you’re changing careers or starting your first one. In this reading, you’ll learn how to find the right online job board for what you need in an entry-level job, apprenticeship, or internship in UX design, as well as potential places to network for job opportunities.

Online job board
1. 
Jobs on Google Search
. Searching for a job on Google Search is easy — just type your job search terms into the search bar at Google.com. The Google Search will automatically search for jobs near you with the terms you choose (for example, UX designer), using your current location. 

Not interested in staying in your current area or willing to relocate for the right position? You can filter your search. From the Google Search results page, find the jobs search box, headed in blue, and click on the “more jobs” link under the first few results. You’ll go to a search page with more options for filtering and sorting. From there, change the location, job type, employer, or any of the other filters. Click on the button and you’ll see your options, like full-time, contractor, part-time, and internship. Or, click the filter to look for jobs labeled as “work from home.” These are becoming much more common for all types of jobs!

Google for Jobs is an aggregator, meaning it pulls job postings from all over the internet, including other job search boards, company websites, and government job portals. In other words, it’s extensive!

2. 
Indeed
. Indeed is another large job aggregator. Anyone can search on the website for free. It has similar filters as Jobs on Google Search. Each job posting includes a brief description of the job and a link to another website to apply. If you register with Indeed, you can create a profile and upload your resume so your searches are more targeted. You can also apply to some jobs directly through Indeed if you have an account.

3. 
Glassdoor
. Glassdoor has a lot of similar features to Indeed and Jobs on Google Search. To search on Glassdoor, you need to create an account and provide some identifying information, like your job and education background. What sets Glassdoor apart from some of the other sites is the information about the companies posting jobs, including typical salaries for various positions within the company and example questions from interviews. Salaries and reviews are self-reported by Glassdoor’s users who are former and current employees of each company listed, so these reviews can be a useful tool for filling out your application or preparing for an interview.

4.
 
ZipRecruiter
. Like Glassdoor, you need to register to use ZipRecruiter. Employers post their jobs directly to the site, and then ZipRecruiter matches interested applicants, based on their resumes, with the job postings. You can declare your interest in a particular job too, but you often don’t need to do so formally; the employer sees your interest and your resume and decides whether to contact you based on your perceived match for the job. You’ll get a notification if an employer reviews your information. Like most of the major job sites, you can also opt in to receive emails from the website with potential job matches

5. Job boards for UX designers (
Dribbble
, 
Behance
, 
Smashing Magazine
, etc.). You’ve already learned a lot about social networking sites specifically for UX designers, and you’ve likely visited many resources, like Smashing Magazine, during the completion of this program. These sites have their own job boards for full-time, part-time, and freelance jobs, as well as internships and apprenticeships. You might apply directly through the job board or be redirected to a company’s own website. One benefit of these types of job search engines is that the companies looking to hire usually post the jobs directly, so they’re more curated and specialized. Another benefit of a job board on a UX design site is that you can post examples of your work. Although you’ll want to link directly to your portfolio no matter how you apply for a job, being able to post samples of work you’ve done — and customize your application to be more creative — is an upside to these industry-specific boards.

6.
 
Linkedin
. You’re likely already very familiar with LinkedIn, especially if you completed the first course of this program. In fact, if you created an account on the professional networking site and filled in your professional background and resume, you’re already halfway to applying for jobs here! You don’t have to register with LinkedIn to look for jobs, but there are a lot of benefits to doing so. Many recruiters and hiring managers use LinkedIn to find potential employees or freelancers; if you’re actively looking for a job, it’s often as simple as signaling that you’re open to opportunities, a setting within your LinkedIn profile page. You can also search for and apply to jobs directly from LinkedIn. Sometimes you’ll be taken to a company website to formally apply; other times, you might just share your profile and interest in the job with the hiring manager and wait for someone to contact you. 

Either way, the most important things to do for LinkedIn is keep your profile up to date and link to your professional portfolio. One other option: You can ask your connections, either former employers or classmates, to recommend you and write testimonials to be posted on your profile. This reinforces your work ethic as an employee and talents as a UX designer.

Design Gigs for Good
. For a much more specialized job searching site, check out Design Gigs for Good. Their goal is to get you a job in UX design and make the world a better place. Each job posted on their curated board is designed to effect change, whether that’s a role on an equity design team or a job at a company saving endangered wildlife. (Their mission statement says, “...As long as the gig relates to design and social impact, this board has you covered.”) If you feel passionate about jobs that are specifically about doing good in the world, this website might be a good fit for you. Because their mission is so specific, their job postings are much more limited in number. However, there are still a variety of position types (full time, contract, etc.), locations (including remote work), and expertise levels (internships, fellowships, and senior-level positions, for example).

This list is just a selection of the job-search sites available to you as a UX designer. As you click or scroll through each site, you might find benefits or drawbacks to a specific job board that makes it more or less suitable to your needs. If you live in a major city, you’ll probably have plenty of opportunities available to you. If you live in a smaller town, or you want to work remotely, you may have to look a little harder to figure out your options. (There’s always your local newspaper and small businesses near you!) But with any luck, you’ll have a variety of positions to choose from when you’re ready to start your new career.

Networking opportunities
Of course, online job boards aren’t the only option for your job search. Networking, whether it’s in person or online, is a hugely important method for finding jobs in any field, UX design included.

Linkedin
. Okay, so you already learned about LinkedIn in this reading. But it’s not just a place to apply for jobs. Recruiters actively seek out potential employees on the site, but you don’t have to wait until they come to you! Connecting with recruiters on LinkedIn is perfectly acceptable. You might look for a recruiter from a local agency you’ve heard good things about; or, if you’re interested in working at a specific company, you can seek out recruiters who work for that organization already. Politely express interest in any open jobs, and see what happens! LinkedIn is also the place to connect with former colleagues, managers, or teachers. Let your network know you’re starting a new career in UX design. Most people love to help others!

Conferences. Whether they’re online or in person, industry conferences are useful in many ways. You learn more about your field during presentations and panels; you meet other people who are working in the industry; and you connect with hiring managers who are looking to expand their teams. Not everyone goes to a conference looking for a new hire. However, they’re a great opportunity to meet new people, and new connections mean new opportunities for jobs in the future. Search online for UX design conferences near you or in an area you would be willing to travel to. 

Job fairs. You might have attended a job fair at your high school or in your town at some point. Often they’re hosted by a group of employers who are interested in hiring new talent or advertising their company as a great place to work. Although a job fair isn’t as likely to be focused solely on UX design, it is likely that companies who attend will need to hire UX designers. You might be surprised by who you meet and what roles you can find. To find a job fair near you, check with local high schools, community colleges, universities, and workforce development programs.

It might seem overwhelming when you begin your job search. There are so many places to look at so many job openings to sort through. But the more you research, the easier it’ll be to pinpoint the exact type of job you’d like to apply for. And you’ll be on your way to snagging that first interview. Get ready, because that day is coming up soon!
