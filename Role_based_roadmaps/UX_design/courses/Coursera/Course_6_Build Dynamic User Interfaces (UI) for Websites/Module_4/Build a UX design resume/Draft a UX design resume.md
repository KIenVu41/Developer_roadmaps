You have learned about the different ways to approach UX design resumes. Now, you’ll review a UX designer’s resume that highlights new UX skills and helps introduce potential employers to their skills, experience, and accomplishments. Let’s get started!

The template
The UX designer used Figma to create their resume. They used a 
template
, found the file name, and opened the drop-down menu. Then, they simply selected “Duplicate to your drafts.” The designer used this copy of the template to edit.

The template is a starting point. The UX designer can edit it to reflect what they need and to fit with their personal brand.

Now, let’s review the UX designer’s resume.

Contact information
At the top of the resume, the UX designer entered their name, email address, and phone number. Below their name, they included their desired job title: UX designer. 

Tip: For a UX designer, it’s a good idea to share a link to a social media site that is used for business, such as LinkedIn, along with a link to a portfolio.

Skills
The UX designer listed also skills relevant to their desired job. This section will help the UX designer stand out as a candidate with employers. It shares their technical and soft skills. As a reminder, technical skills are things like Figma, as well as design knowledge, like wireframing and visual design. Soft skills are things related to communication or collaboration, like critical thinking and team building. The UX designer could explain these skills in a statement that begins with an adjective. Here are some examples:

Proficient in UX design tools: Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch

Proficient in Slack and Skype

Great communication skills within a team

Fluent in Spanish

Experience
In this section, the UX designer added their job experience. The key things they added for each position include: 

The name of the company they worked for and the role they held there

The month and year that they started the job, and the month and year they ended the job

Tip: If the UX designer is still employed at the company, they would indicate that by writing “present.” 

A couple of lines describing their experience

Tip: Each sentence should start with an action verb, like “designed” or “managed.” A great way to find action verbs is to search the internet for a list of resume action verbs.

All of the relevant jobs they’ve had, starting with the most recent at the top

Tip: The finished resume should be no longer than one page in length. If they’ve had many jobs, the UX designer should only list the most recent or relevant work experience. It’s important to include information that the prospective employer needs to know for the role. 

Education
The UX designer entered the highest degree they’ve earned. In this example, they’ve earned a GED and the Google UX Design Certificate. Other important education information includes:

Relevant education, whether through a university or an independent program

Area of study, the number of units completed, or the year of graduation

Certificate programs (like this one)

Tip: To show that a certificate education is still in-progress, “Present” should be noted instead of a completion date.

Key takeaways
A good UX design resume should:

Be concise and no longer than one page in length

Include some basic contact information

Show recent, relevant experience—like the UX projects you’ve been completing as part of this certificate 

Highlight skills and tools that showcase current skills for the job you’re applying for 

Include your education, like the Google UX Design Certificate; additional relevant professional history; and skills or hobbies
