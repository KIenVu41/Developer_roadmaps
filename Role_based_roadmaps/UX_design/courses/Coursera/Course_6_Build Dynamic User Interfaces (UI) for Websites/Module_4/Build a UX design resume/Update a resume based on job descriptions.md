Why Customizing Your Resume Matters

Sending the same generic resume to every recruiter isn't effective.
Different companies and roles have distinct requirements and expectations.
Using Job Descriptions to Guide Your Resume

Job descriptions highlight the specific skills and experience needed for the role.
Use keywords from the job description in your resume to get noticed by hiring managers and applicant tracking systems.
Tailoring Your Resume Content

Emphasize relevant projects and skills that align with the job description.
Consider removing experiences that aren't directly applicable to the specific role.
