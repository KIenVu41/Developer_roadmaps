You’ve already learned the steps to creating a polished resume that features the essentials: your contact information, your educational background, and your job history. But, you’re a UX designer, so don’t be afraid of making your resume look special! You should be approaching your resume’s layout with the same user-focused attention as you would with anything else you'd design. That means thinking about many of the design principles and elements you've learned about in this program (hierarchy, grid, color, and negative space) and applying them to your resume, to draw the viewer's attention and make yourself stand out. This is also the perfect opportunity to showcase your personal brand! You can do that by including an original logo, a few distinct colors, or an interesting typeface.

Though it’s perfectly fine to create your resume in a word processing program like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, you might want to take it up another notch by editing your resume in a design tool like Adobe InDesign or Illustrator, Figma, or another program. Many UX designers create a basic outline of their resume in a document to ensure that the essential content is there and properly formatted, then refine it using a design tool. Think of this process in the same way you create wireframes before moving to mockups. Here are some common design choices UX designers make when building their resumes:

Two-column format. Instead of using the standard one-column format typical of basic resumes, many UX designers use a two-column format. This structure allows them to create a grid, ensuring they can line up elements on a line, which makes scanning a resume significantly easier. Check out the alignment on

. It has two clear columns as well as a distinct row across the top of the page.

Color. Although black-and-white resumes are just fine, many designers choose to strategically use a pop of color in their resumes to highlight a major element and tie back in their personal brand. For example, they might choose an accent color for their name, job title, and section headings, like Googler

. Whichever color you choose, make sure it’s readable and it isn’t random. Buttery yellow might be your favorite color, but it’s probably too hard to see on a resume’s white background. Remember: usability is key. Plus, the color selected should exist in your personal branding, meaning it might appear in your logo or on your portfolio site, too.

Logos. You’re not required to create your own logo for your resume, but it sure is a fun bit of personal branding. Many UX designers create a logo that represents their name or initials and feature it in a corner of their resume. For an example, check out

. Zachary created a logo that creatively makes the letters “ZB.” If you create something like Zachary’s logo, lean into it. Feature it on your portfolio website and business cards, too.

Bullet points. Another way to make your resume more readable is with bullet points. They break up the text and make it easier to skim. Bullets are also a fantastic way to bring in hints of your personal brand without overdoing it. The bullet can use a pop of color from your personal logo, for example. Emily's resume leans into hints of light green.

Type style. Be creative, yet intentional, with the typographical choices you make. You want to express your personal brand and stand out, but you don't want to distract from the content on the page. You might choose one font for your name and another for the rest of your resume. Or maybe certain words, like former employers, will be bold, while less important details, like dates of employment, are in a lighter color or weighted font. Establishing visual hierarchy makes your resume easy for a recruiter to scan. You might also use type to emphasize your personal brand. 

Whatever tool you use to create your resume, make sure the final file format matches the one requested in the job description, if there is one. For example, some recruiters prefer PDFs, while others want Docx (MS Word). Prove that you’re paying attention; save your resume in that preferred file type before you submit your application. 

And finally, it doesn’t matter what your resume looks like if it’s confusing or there are spelling or grammatical errors. Ask a friend or family member to review your resume any time you make significant changes. Or visit your high school career counselor or a workforce development office to get a professional opinion. A fresh perspective is essential during this process. Good luck!
