Understanding Sitemaps

Sitemaps visually represent a website's structure, outlining the hierarchy and connections between different pages.
They help users easily navigate a website and find the information they need.
Creating a Sitemap

Consider common website pages like homepages, product pages, and shopping carts.
Utilize user research data, such as empathy maps and user journeys, to guide the sitemap's structure and ensure it aligns with user needs.
Benefits of Sitemaps

Sitemaps help identify potential navigation issues and missing pages early in the design process.
A well-defined sitemap improves user experience and can save time and resources during development.
