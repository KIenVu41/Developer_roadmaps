Website Structure Models

Hierarchical Model: Organizes content in a top-down structure, similar to a family tree, starting with broad categories (parent level) and branching into more specific subcategories (child level). Example: HBO.com
Sequential Model: Guides users through a predefined path of steps, often used for processes like online forms or surveys. Example: Online car insurance quote forms.
Why Website Structure Matters

User Expectations: Structure models align with how users anticipate websites to function based on their past experiences.
Improved Navigation: Organization through structure aids users in finding information efficiently.
Tested Effectiveness: These models have been refined over time based on user feedback, ensuring a smoother user experience.
