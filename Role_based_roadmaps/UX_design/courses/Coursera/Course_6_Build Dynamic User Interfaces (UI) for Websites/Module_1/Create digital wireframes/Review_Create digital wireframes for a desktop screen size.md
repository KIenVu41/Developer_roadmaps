As you’ve learned, transitioning from low-fidelity paper wireframes to low-fidelity digital wireframes is a big step, so it’s important that designers ask themselves some key questions before starting:

Is there a clear understanding of the layout of the website? It’s important to carefully consider the homepage layout in the wireframing stage. There are several homepage layouts that you’ve learned about in this course.

Have a few iterations been created of the paper wireframes?

Has any feedback about the paper wireframes led to new insights that can be incorporated? 

Is it time to start considering various visual elements, like typography, color, and images that will go into later versions of the digital designs?

This checklist helps designers make sure that the transition to digital wireframes is happening at the correct stage of the design process.

Now, we’ll review how a designer created digital wireframe for the desktop version of the Tee’s Shirts website. Later, you’ll review how to adapt the digital wireframes you create for smaller screen sizes, like tablets or mobile phones. 

Create a frame in Figma

The first step is to create a page that holds all the pages of each app or website to be designed. To do this, the designer needed to start by creating a working area for the project in Figma by following these steps. 

Open Figma and create a new design file for their project. 

Create a frame by clicking on the Frame tool located on the upper-left toolbar—or by using the shortcut (F). 

Then, on the right sidebar under Frame, use the drop-down option and choose the Wireframe size (1440x1024). This frame is suitable for designing web pages. 

Rename the frame by double-clicking the frame name in the layers panel located on the left to indicate that it is the homepage. 

Study paper wireframes and apply a layout grid
The designer had already created paper wireframes for the desktop version of a responsive website. So, to help remember the layout preferences for the digital wireframes, they took a picture of the paper wireframes, and then uploaded the images onto the frame in Figma. 

The paper wireframes were created on gridded paper because the grids on the paper help designers control spacing and placement of elements that are part of the layout. Preparing a digital version of the grid in Figma will make sure the content is aligned consistently.

Applying the layout grid in Figma includes three elements: 

Margins: the distance between the edge of the frame and the layout grid 

Columns: the vertical columns that are evenly spaced on the grid 

Gutter width: the white space between each column

To specify the layout grid, the designer needs to complete the following steps:

Select the frame where the layout grid is needed.

In the right-hand sidebar, go to the Layout Grid section and click on the “+” button to create a new grid.

Click on the grid icon to the left of the new grid to open the grid panel.

Use the drop-down menu to change the view from Grid to Columns.

Enter the count and color of columns and adjust the other properties of the columns according to the design requirements, such as the type, width, and gutter size.

Once all the desired properties are set, close the panel or click outside of the grid settings panel.

Populate the frame with placeholders
Once the grid was set up, the designer could start building the outline of the homepage by filling in the space with different sized rectangles, circles, and squares.

Keep in mind where the fold of the webpage is. The fold is the term used to describe the bottom border of the browser screen. Content that appears above the fold is visible without scrolling, whereas content that appears below the fold refers to any portion contained further down the webpage.

The top half, or the above-the-fold half of the homepage, is for the content that actually appears on screen when a user accesses the website from a computer.  The above-the-fold half includes the:

Navigation bar: has placeholders for your logo, or call-to-action buttons like the search button

Body section: contains images and accompanying text about the product

The lower half, or the below-the-fold half of the homepage, is for the content that users need to scroll down to access on the homepage. The below-the-fold half includes:

The lower half of the body section

The footer section, which holds things like contact information, social media links, and the main logo

There are no strict rules for how to lay out the page, but common practice is to include the navigation bar and any main calls to action above the fold. That way, users are presented with the more important elements immediately upon accessing the webpage. Designing with the fold in mind helps ensure the hierarchy of content is effective. 

Add placeholder text
Next, the designer went back to the images of their paper wireframes. All the sections with placeholders containing lines were replaced with text that indicates each section. It’s not important to write in all the text at this stage; so the designer just needed to fill in enough placeholder text to act as a guide for when high-fidelity designs were developed later.

To indicate a section or heading, the designer created a short phrase to remember where to add text later. For body text, designers generally use lorem ipsum, Latin placeholder text that identifies where content will go and how a page will be laid out, without adding meaningful content. Search online for “lorem ipsum,” then copy and paste the text from there.

Here’s an example of using lorem ipsum as placeholder text:

Repeat for the all pages 
The designer then applied the same process to the rest of their desktop wireframes.

Key takeaways
When you’re ready, you can use this review as a guide to create your own digital wireframes and compare your work to the examples.

As you compare, ask yourself: 

Did I use my paper wireframes as a guide?

Did I create digital wireframes that include every stage of the user flow, starting at the homepage?

Did I create placeholders (rectangles, squares, and circles) for all the visual elements that will be added in later?

Did I use lorem ipsum as a placeholder for the body text?
