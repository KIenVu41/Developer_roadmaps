 Introduction
This review focuses on how to take digital wireframes for a desktop screen and create additional screen sizes in Figma in order to make the website responsive. 

You’ve learned that responsive web design:

Increases product usability, especially for smaller devices 

Creates an improved user experience across devices

Drives mobile traffic

Saves money and time

The image below demonstrates how responsive design improves usability across a variety of device sizes. The elements with the same colors contain the same information, but the way the information is presented and sized changes depending on the device. This is how responsive design appears in action. 

Illustration shows how responsive design displays on different device sizes includinga laptop, a tablet, mobile vertical, mobile horizontal and a watch.
Now, you’ll review an example of how a designer created a variety of wireframes for a mobile phone for Tee’s Shirts. Remember, designing a responsive website means adjusting your digital wireframes to fit well on different screen sizes. The desktop version of a responsive website can include more content since the screen size is large, but the layout of the page will need to change when users access the website on a device with a smaller screen size, like a mobile phone or tablet. 

Create a new frame for mobile in Figma
The designer started by opening the desktop version of their digital wireframes in Figma,

clicking on the Frame tool and choosing a mobile phone size from the frame menu.

In this example, the designer selected a Google Pixel 2 and created a name for these new wireframes: “Mobile phone version.” There are many variations of mobile phone sizes to choose from so feel free to try out different ones.

Study paper wireframes
Next, the designer referenced their mobile phone-size paper wireframe mapped on grid paper to examine how best to arrange the elements in their design. The paper drawing represents an extended version of a mobile home screen that extends past 812px.

Translate each element to mobile wireframes
Then the designer added the elements from their desktop wireframe to their mobile wireframe by removing elements that wouldn’t translate to mobile, resizing the ones that would, and changing the layout of the page to work on a narrower screen. The designer used their mobile paper wireframe as a template for where to place things, and how to resize or change them. 

What was resized:
The hero image

The headline text

The body text

What was changed:
Changed the layout of the 3 images 

Added a hamburger menu

Changed the top menu display

Apply space-saving strategies
To make the updates, the designer utilized the following strategies to help save space when sizing down to a smaller screen size.

Create a hamburger menu
Hamburger menus are useful ways to save space and make the website accessible on a smaller device. 

A screenshot of the Figma interface showing three shapes, representing a hamburger menu, drawn from the rectangle tool.
To start the hamburger menu, the designer created the rectangles to represent the buttons in the menu by following these steps:

Click the Rectangle tool, which is directly to the right of the Frame tool in the toolbar at the top of the screen. Draw a short, narrow rectangle in the top left of the frame. In the right panel, click Fill and choose a color for the rectangle, like dark gray. Copy and paste the rectangle two times and create equal spacing between the three rectangles to represent the hamburger menu.

The designer then created a group:

Click the first rectangle, and hold down the Shift key on the keyboard while clicking the other two rectangles. Right-click and select Group.

Finally, the designer named the group of three rectangles “Hamburger Menu” by doing the following: 

Click the first rectangle, and hold down the Shift key on your keyboard while clicking the other two rectangles. Right-click and select “Group.” In the Assets panel on the left side of the screen, name this group “Hamburger menu.”

Create a flyout menu
The designer created a flyout menu to show additional information that wouldn’t fit in the hamburger menu buttons, so that when a user clicks on one of the hamburger menu buttons, a flyout menu appears with even more choices. Flyout menus or drop-down menus are strategies to use for information that won’t fit on the mobile version of the website homepage. 

To move icons or information into the flyout menu, click each element and drag it onto the “Flyout menu” page. 

Click the homepage wireframe, and copy and paste it. Name the new, pasted version “Flyout menu.” 

Add icon placeholders
The designer also wanted to use icons to visually represent important information in the mobile version, like the search or cart functions. They created circles as placeholders using the Rectangle tool in the toolbar at the top of the screen, and selecting “Ellipse'. These placeholders will indicate that an image or icon will be added during the high-fidelity phase of design phase.

Repeat for other pages of the wireframe
The designer then repeated these steps for the other pages of their website and ended up with a full set of wireframes optimized for viewing on a mobile device, in addition to the desktop wireframes.

Key takeaways
As you create your own additional wireframes, be sure to consider adjustments to the layout of the website for a smaller screen size. For example, you might need to reduce the number of columns of content to just one or two columns in the mobile version of the responsive website. Or, you might need to vertically stack information in the mobile version that was listed side-by-side horizontally in the desktop version. You can use this review as a guide and compare your own work to an example that meets all the criteria. 

As you compare, ask yourself: 

Did I create additional screen size variation based on my paper wireframes? 

Did I use a frame from the list of device sizes?  

Did I reuse and modify the elements from my desktop design?

Did I create a version of my homepage for an additional screen size?
