 In this reading, you will review three completed exemplars of digital wireframes for a responsive website based on the three prompts that you’ve been following throughout this certificate program: 

Design an app and a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner.

Design an app and a progressive website that helps residents of a large city, with over 100 parks, to reserve and pay the rental fee for an outdoor pavilion for an event.

Create an app and a responsive website that allows a local business to monitor its inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information.

These exemplars range in complexity and are completed versions of the activity you completed in 
Review: Create digital wireframes for a desktop screen size
. When you’re ready to create your own digital wireframes for your responsive website, you can compare your work to these examples, which meet all the criteria required for digital wireframes. There’s also a short explanation of how each exemplar meets the requirements for digital wireframes. 

Paper wireframes to digital wireframes
Once the paper homepage wireframes are ready, frames need to be created in Figma that match the correct device size—in this case, for a desktop. Each element on the homepage was created in Figma individually using the paper wireframe as a reference. Once all the elements were created, they were placed into the corresponding frames following the same arrangement as the paper wireframes. When all of the desktop elements were translated from the paper versions to the digital versions, the process was repeated for the other screens in each design.

The digital and paper versions of the desktop wireframes for each prompt are shown below for comparison.

Digital wireframes
The completed user flows for each prompt are represented below as digital wireframes for desktop.

MediMatch Connect
User flow of the MediMatch Connect website represented in four digital wireframe screens for desktop. From left to right, andtop to bottom: Homepage, search results, professional profile, and contact professional.
To view a larger version of the digital wireframes for MediMatch Connect for desktop, open the following attachment:

A total of four screens are presented for each version of the MediMatch Connect digital wireframes. This is because the user flow from the home screen to the contact the professional screen required a total of four screens to complete. 

Fairweather Pavilion Rentals
User flow of the Fairweather Pavilion Rentals website represented in four digital wireframe screens for desktop. From left toHomepage, pavilion detail page, date reservation page, and payment page.

In each of these sets of wireframes, it’s clear that the digital wireframes are building off and refining paper wireframes. They also show simple, clearly defined elements and information architecture. Critical thinking has been applied to the hierarchy of information on each screen.

Key takeaways
All of the example digital wireframes presented here are complete exemplars ranging in complexity. You can compare your digital wireframes to these exemplars whenever you’re ready. As you compare, ask yourself:

Do my digital wireframes:

Include at least three screens?

Demonstrate a complete user flow that a user can complete? 

Clearly define the UI elements intended for each screen, including navigation menus, buttons, visuals, and text fields?

Indicate the organization or hierarchy of any elements depicted on the screen?

If any of your answers are no, return to wireframes and make adjustments. You can use the three exemplars provided in this reading as a reference when creating your own digital wireframes for desktop websites.
