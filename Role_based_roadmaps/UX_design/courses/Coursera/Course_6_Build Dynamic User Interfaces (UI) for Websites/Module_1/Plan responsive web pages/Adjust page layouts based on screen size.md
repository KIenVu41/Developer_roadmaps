Designing for Smaller Screens

When adapting a website for smaller screens, you have less space for elements like icons, images, and text.
You might need to scale down details and reduce text size to maintain accessibility and a visually appealing design.
Common Elements in Responsive Design

Hamburger menus are icons with three lines that, when clicked, expand to reveal navigation options, maximizing screen space.
Cards are used to present content and actions related to a single subject in an easily scannable format.
Carousels for Image Display

Carousels, also known as slideshows, display multiple images or cards in a scrollable format.
They are useful for showcasing many images, like in a photography gallery, and for fitting more content on a smaller screen.
