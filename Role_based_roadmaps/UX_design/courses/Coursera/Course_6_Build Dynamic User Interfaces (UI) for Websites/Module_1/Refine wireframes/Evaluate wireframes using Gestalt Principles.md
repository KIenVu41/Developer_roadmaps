Gestalt Principles and Wireframing

Gestalt Principles explain how humans visually group elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images.
Applying these principles to wireframing helps create visually appealing and easy-to-understand designs.
Key Gestalt Principles

Similarity: Elements that share visual characteristics like shape, size, or color are perceived as having the same function.
Proximity: Elements placed closer together are perceived as more related than those spaced apart.
Applying Gestalt Principles

Use visual cues like borders to indicate that elements within a defined area are related (Common Region).
Ensure elements intended to have the same function share a consistent visual appearance (Similarity).
