Designing for Accessibility

Understanding how individuals with disabilities interact with your product is a key aspect of UX design.
Wireframes should include features that enhance accessibility, enabling users of all abilities to navigate and engage with your website effectively.
Headings and Landmarks for Navigation

Clear headings are crucial for visual hierarchy and screen reader navigation. Annotate heading levels (e.g., H2, H3) in your wireframes for developers.
Landmarks, like navigation bars and footers, provide structural cues for assistive technologies, aiding users in understanding and navigating the layout.
Initial Focus and Clarity

Guide user attention strategically with initial focus, often directed to the top of the page or the primary heading (H1).
A clean and uncluttered interface reduces cognitive overload, making navigation easier for all users.
