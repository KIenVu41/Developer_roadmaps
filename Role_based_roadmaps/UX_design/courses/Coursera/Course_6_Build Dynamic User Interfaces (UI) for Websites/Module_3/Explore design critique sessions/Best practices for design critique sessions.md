Preparing for the session:

Before the session, you should prepare a brief presentation that addresses the five key questions about your design, such as who you are designing for and what problem you are trying to solve.
You should also ensure you provide reviewers with enough information to give feedback, considering the session's time constraints and the complexity of your designs.
During the session:

During the session, focus on active listening and asking clarifying questions to understand the reviewer's perspective.
Remember to be open to feedback and avoid getting defensive, even if you disagree with the criticism.
After the session:

After the session, take time to process the feedback received and decide which suggestions to implement in your design.
View the feedback as navigational guidance, helping you steer your design in the right direction.
