What is a Case Study?

A case study is a summary of a design project that typically includes the project goal, your role, the process, and the outcome.
It's a way to demonstrate your design knowledge, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.
Why are Case Studies Important?

Recruiters and hiring managers look for case studies in portfolios to evaluate a designer's abilities.
They provide a tangible example of your skills and experience, showing how you approach and solve design problems.
