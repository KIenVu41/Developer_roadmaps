Why Feedback Matters:

Feedback helps UX designers refine their designs and become better, as it offers diverse perspectives and potential improvements.
Regularly seeking and incorporating feedback helps build confidence and improve design skills over time.
Giving Effective Feedback:

Tailor your feedback to the recipient's role and experience level for maximum impact.
Provide specific reasons and explanations for your feedback, avoiding vague statements.
Focus on identifying design problems rather than offering solutions, empowering the designer to find their own fixes.
