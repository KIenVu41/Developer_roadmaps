Understanding Design Systems

Design systems provide UX designers with standardized guidelines and components, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the design process.
Google's Material Design, available at material.io, is a publicly accessible design system used globally for creating apps and websites.
Navigating Material Design

The Material Design website offers comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and resources categorized into sections like "Get Started," "Develop," "Foundations," "Styles," and "Components."
For practical application, Material Design provides a Figma Design Kit, enabling designers to readily integrate pre-built components into their projects.
