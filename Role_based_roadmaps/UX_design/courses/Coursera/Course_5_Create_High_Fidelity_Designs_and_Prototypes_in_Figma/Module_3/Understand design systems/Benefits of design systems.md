Benefits of Design Systems

Consistency and Brand Reinforcement: Design systems ensure visual consistency across products, strengthening brand identity. For example, Google's Material Design uses specific colors, fonts, and shapes across its products.
Scalability and Efficiency: Design systems streamline workflows, making it easier to iterate on designs, onboard new designers, and save time and money.

As a UX designer, you'll need to adapt to and potentially improve existing design systems.
