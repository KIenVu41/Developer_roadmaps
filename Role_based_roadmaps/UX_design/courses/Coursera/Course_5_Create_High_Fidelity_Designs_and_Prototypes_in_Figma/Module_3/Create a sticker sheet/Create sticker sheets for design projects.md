You’ve learned that sticker sheets (or design kits) are collections of reusable assets in a design system. Assets include components, such as buttons and icons, as well as the elements that make up those components, such as color and fill. By assembling reusable assets, sticker sheets make designing more efficient and consistent. With a sticker sheet, designers can:

Copy assets from the sticker sheet and paste them into the design 

Share the sticker sheets with teammates and other collaborators

Update all instances of an asset by updating the original in the sticker sheet

This reading explains how to create a sticker sheet for a design system in Figma. When complete, the sticker sheet will contain the designs system’s most-used assets, including:

Reusable UI components, such as buttons, menus, and cards

Typographic elements, including typefaces and font families

Color choices, including an overall palette and specific component colors

Icons representing recurring actions or navigation choices a user might interact with

When you’re ready to create sticker sheets for your portfolio projects and other designs, follow these guidelines and best practices.

Open your project in Figma
Go to 
www.figma.com
 or start the Figma desktop app. Make sure you're logged in and on the correct Figma account. Next, on the left of the side navigation bar, click on Recent and you’ll see your recent projects. These are files you recently opened or viewed. Search for your project and click on it. 

Note: Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for 
Navigating UI3: Figma’s New UI
. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being. 

Figma left-hand navigation bar open with Recent option highlighted.
Create a new page in your Figma file

When you start a new file in Figma, you have one page in the file. Remember that pages are where your frames live. To keep things organized in your project file, separate different parts of the project into different pages. To create a new page: 

Select the Layers panel in the top-left corner of your screen. 

Click the Page 1 option. You’ll notice the default page (Page 1) is already in place.

Click on the + button to add another page. If it’s your second page, the default name will be Page 2.

Rename the page by double-clicking the default name, typing the new name, and either hitting enter or clicking off of the text-entry field. 

Use a name like “Sticker Sheet,” “Design Kit,” “Style Guide,” or something else that will help you identify what the page contains.

Create a new frame

Create a new frame within the page to act as a container for your sticker sheet. To create a new frame: 

Select the Frame Tool from the Region Tools menu in the top-left corner of your screen in Figma. You can also use the keyboard shortcut cmd+F (on Mac) or F (on PC). 

Draw a frame of any size or choose any size option from the right sidebar. You can choose the Desktop option, which will give you plenty of room to create your sticker sheet.

Rename the Frame by double-clicking the default name that appears above the frame. You can also change it by going to the Layer panel and double-clicking the default name there.

Select UI assets for your sticker sheet 
Before you build your sticker sheet, you need to select assets to include. Designers typically select assets as they work through the design process. Once they develop a new component or define a new element, it can go into the sticker sheet. While each sticker sheet is unique, they typically include typography, color, and buttons.

Typography
As you define a design’s typography and add it to your sticker sheet, select typefaces and fonts that align with your product’s branding, tone, and style. For example, if you’re creating an app for kids, rounded typefaces can be very appealing and playful. If you want the typeface to appear more serious or professional, choose something more simple. 

Here's an example of an app Google created for parents who want to get their preteens and teens involved in art. The app is called GeoShapes. For the app, our UX designer chose the typeface Yaldevi Colombo. Here’s an example of how this typeface can vary with different fonts: 

Font family for Yaldevi Colombo typeface.
Above, you’ll notice the different font weights, with the most essential information being bold and the least important represented as a lighter weight. Play around with different fonts in Figma and decide what you feel each one communicates. You’ve been looking at fonts your entire life, so you’re an expert already! As you browse through the fonts in Figma, you can customize your choices by changing their color, spacing, opacity, and more.

Color
Sticker sheets are an ideal place to define your design’s colors. Color is an integral part of a product’s branding: It can evoke emotion, establish information hierarchy, convey meaning, and do other important things in UX design. To learn more about color theory and how the psychology of color can affect users, check out this article from UserPeek: “
What is Color Psychology in UX Design?
”

Here’s the color scheme we chose for the GeoShapes app:

Color scheme for GeoShapes app including primary, secondary, and grayscale palettes.
The main, or primary, colors for the app are red, purple, and green. Colors often have implied meanings. For example, red represents passion, purple represents creativity and originality, and green represents growth and balance. All of these traits are important for cultivating a love of art. We chose a strong set of primary colors, secondary colors that are less vibrant than the primary colors, and a grayscale with a touch of these colors infused into them. As you build your sticker sheet, consider the theory behind the colors you choose and how those colors will represent the product you’re designing. 

In your sticker sheet, you can create swatches for your colors by: 

Creating shapes, like small circles or squares

Filling them with the colors you choose

Labeling each shape with the hex code for that color

These color swatches will be a great reference as you continue to design, and you can update them to reflect new color choices.  

Buttons
As you populate your sticker sheet and define the style that your app will use, you can cycle through button types to see which you prefer for your app. Button styles should reflect your brand’s style just as much as typography and color. They should also draw users’ attention and guide them as they make choices and take actions in a product.

As you design your buttons, keep in mind that buttons, like hyperlinks, should have an instantly recognizable appearance. They are most often an outline shape on a white background or a shape with a solid fill. They can also appear as icons, text, and other formats.

To create a button in Figma:

Create a text layer by clicking the Text tool in the toolbar (it’s the T icon), or by pressing T on your keyboard.

Once the Text tool is active, click on your sticker sheet frame (or anywhere on your Figma canvas) and type the name of the button you want to create. For a sticker sheet, you can use “Button” as a placeholder. You can change the name by double-clicking the button’s text layer in the left sidebar.

Convert the text layer to an auto layout frame: Select the text layer and use the Shift + A shortcut (press Shift and A simultaneously).

Style the button by using the features in the right sidebar:

To adjust the color and fill, select the button’s frame layer, and then select the plus sign (+) in the right sidebar.

To adjust the corners, select the right sidebar icon that looks like a rounded corner.

To adjust the padding (the distance between the text and the sides of the button), select the button’s frame and hover over it. Pink handles will appear. You can click and drag these handles, or you can click once on the handle and add a number in the box that pops up.

To add shadow effects, select the Effects option in the right sidebar. Then, use the dropdown menu to select Inner shadow, and select the Effect settings icon to change the shadow. (The icon is a small circle with lines radiating around it, like a line drawing of a sun.)

 “Design your first button
” resource from Figma

Here's how we designed the buttons for the GeoShapes app.

Buttons and button variants for GeoShapes app.
The buttons above are in the brand’s secondary colors, and the corners of the buttons are more rounded than sharp. Each of these corners is set at 5. The grayscale buttons both have drop shadows set at 25% with a blur of 4. All six of these button variants should be added to the project’s sticker sheet.

Save assets as components
To add an asset to a sticker sheet, you should save it as a component in Figma. Before you read any further, a note on terminology: Component is a general term for reusable design assets like buttons, logos, icons, textboxes, and so on. It’s also a Figma-specific term for an asset that has been saved with the Create Component function.

Saving items with the Create Component function is key for efficient and consistent design. Once an asset is saved as a component, the changes made to that component are applied to all other instances of the component across the design. 

To save an asset as a component:

Ensure that you’ve named each asset in your Layer panel. This is particularly important for assets with a few pieces, like buttons or color swatches.

Select your asset, either in the Layer panel or on the canvas.

Use one of these methods to create a component:

Right-click on that asset and choose the Create component option.

Use a keyboard shortcut:

Mac: Option + Command + K

Windows: Ctrl + Alt + K

Select the Create component icon in the toolbar. The Create component icon looks like four diamonds.

As you populate your sticker sheet with saved components, the sticker sheet becomes both a reference and a hub for editing. Rather than individually update each instance of a component, you can make the update once to the saved component in the sticker sheet.

States and variants
One thing to keep in mind as you create a sticker sheet is that some of your components won’t always look the same. For example, the buttons in the GeoShape Navigation have two different versions. 

Each version is one of the button’s states. States are visual representations of the status of a specific component or interactive element. As in the example, two common states are active and inactive.

It’s important to include states in your sticker sheets. In Figma, you can use the Variants function to organize states into single containers. For example, consider the different states collected in this variants container from the GeoShapes sticker sheet:

Add UI assets to the sticker sheet
Once you have selected UI assets and saved them as components, it's time to add them to the sticker sheet.

Start by choosing the typography for the headings you’ll use to categorize and label your assets.

To avoid confusion, choose typography that’s clearly different from the typography you are using in your design. A standard typeface like Helvetica, Roboto, or Arial may work well. Using distinct typography makes it easier for a viewer to differentiate between the typographical design elements you include in the sticker sheet and the text you use to categorize and label those elements.  

Next, arrange the assets by category. Keep all the buttons together, all the icons together, and so on. To make the arrangement logical and friendly for the user (you!), use the same design principles you use in your wireframes and mockups: grids, containment, negative space, Gestalt principles, and so on. They’ll all help you create a sticker sheet that is tidy and usable.

Save your work
Figma will automatically save your work, but you should also save evidence of your work for your design portfolio. Remember to:

Take photos of your progress and save them. These photos can include progress photos of sketches, photos of different stages of the activity, pictures of brainstorming sessions, and even photos of you working. 

Save all of your work to your computer, a hard drive, or a Google Drive folder to make sure you have all the resources you'll need later in the course for your portfolio.

Key takeaways
Sticker sheets help UX designers work faster, smarter, and more collaboratively. From fonts to buttons, logos to animations, and more, you can collect every key element and component for your designs and have them available to use any time. 

Sticker sheets also ease the collaboration process if you’re working as part of a large team. When you share your designs with developers, a sticker sheet will clarify the coding process as they work on each component. The sticker sheet will also serve as a style guide for fellow designers and help them stay consistent as well. For example, if a product’s buttons have rounded edges, your team will know not to create sharp rectangular ones.
