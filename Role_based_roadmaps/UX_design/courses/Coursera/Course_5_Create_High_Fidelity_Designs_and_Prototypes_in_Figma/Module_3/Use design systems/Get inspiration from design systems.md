As a UX designer, creating stunning visuals is crucial for attracting users, maintaining consistency across products, and establishing a brand. For example, think of the bottle of shampoo or laundry detergent that you use. Certain visual elements make the brand of that product instantly recognizable and might have even attracted you to buy it. The design on the bottle might have a signature font, a distinctive color palette, or a clever icon. Companies work hard to create smart designs and an entire design system they can apply to all their products!

Remember, a design system is a series of reusable elements that allow teams to design and develop a product following predetermined standards. A design system is the visual foundation of a company’s products and is key to attracting users. For UX designers, design systems are a great way to maintain consistency within a design and across products. 

Below is an image of a basic design system for a made-up arts magazine, Artniche. The design system outlines design elements used by Artniche, like typography, colors, and buttons. In other words, this typography and color palette are used across the magazine's app and website to ensure consistency and make designing easier. 


The number of elements included in your design system is up to you and depends on the goal of your product. The important thing to remember is that creating a system to outline the design elements you use is the best way to create brand and product consistency, and saves designers a lot of time. The design system shapes the world behind the product!

Showcase a design system in your portfolio
Once you create a design system for the product you're designing in this course, you’ll want to include it in your portfolio. For example, Google UX designer Dane co-created an app called Pocket for a class project. In Dane's portfolio case study, he included details about the product’s design system, like the typography, iconography, and buttons, as shown in the image below:

For your own portfolio, you should document your design choices in each case study. Whether you create a comprehensive design system with a bunch of elements or simply outline the icons and colors you frequently use, including a design system is a great way to spotlight your creative choices and enrich your portfolio.
