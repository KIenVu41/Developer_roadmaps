Icons are images or symbols that stand for specific actions or tools in an app or website. Using icons in your designs can quickly communicate concepts, instead of explaining a concept's meaning with words. 

Icons range in style and meaning, as shown in the images above of a profile icon, a location icon, a favorites icon, and a zoom icon. There are two universal icons that are used across mobile apps and website designs: home and search. The home icon is represented by the shape of a house, and the search is represented by a magnifying glass. Chances are, you will probably include these two icons in the designs you're creating in this course! 

You can import, create, adjust, and save icons right in a design tool like Figma. Check it out.

Import and create icons
There are lots of resources to help you import and create icons for your own design project. By default, Figma supports Font Awesome, a giant set of customizable icons with an easy-to-read font. With Font Awesome, you can:

Keep icons as-is (regular) or make them solid, so they’re easier to see. 

View and copy items from the Font Awesome cheat sheet.

Right-click an icon to copy it to your clipboard and paste it onto your Canvas in Figma.

Learn more about icons and Font Awesome
 from Figma’s Help Center.

Another option is to import icons from an existing design system, like Google's 
Material Design
 or Apple's 
Human Interface Guidelines
. For example, you can 
add Google Material Design icons
 directly to your workspace in Figma.

Adjust icons
To resize an icon in Figma:

Select the icon that you want to adjust by clicking on it.

Adjust the size and proportions by holding the Shift button as you drag the corner of the icon. 

Consider users
Each time you create or add an icon to your designs, think about the users you're designing for. You want the icons you choose to be inclusive, accessible, and easily understandable for all of the users that your product will reach. Keep in mind these three best practices when it comes to using icons in designs: 

Make icons universal. Consider whether an icon is culturally or geographically specific before adding it to your designs. Will the icon make sense to a global audience, or only for users in the region where you live? Where will the users of the product you're designing be located? Your goal should be to include icons that everyone recognizes and understands, regardless of their background. For example, most users are familiar with the idea that the house icon means "home" which can help everyone navigate your app. 

Consider including a text label. Usually, text labels are included in small font directly below an icon. Including a text label ensures that users who use a screen reader or a new adopter of technology are able to identify the icon. In addition, a text label can clearly describe (in one word!) what the icon means, like writing the label "Search" under a magnifying glass icon.

Keep branding clear. Everything, including your icons, should reflect the imagery you’ve created for your brand. That means that everything across your app needs to have the same color scheme, the same font, and and the same style. For example, check out the 
icon set
 for the Material Design website, and you’ll notice that the color and design flow well between each icon set, and none of the icons look out of place.
