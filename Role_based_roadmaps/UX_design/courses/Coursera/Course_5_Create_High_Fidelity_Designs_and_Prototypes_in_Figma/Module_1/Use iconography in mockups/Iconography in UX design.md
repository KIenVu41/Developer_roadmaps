What is Iconography?

Iconography uses graphic images or symbols, known as icons, to represent subjects or ideas, offering a visually engaging way to convey information.
Icons can indicate actions (like an arrow for direction) or provide supplementary information (like a battery icon showing charge level).
Effective Use of Icons in Design

While some icons are universally recognized (like a house icon for 'home'), others might have cultural interpretations, so choose icons wisely based on your target audience.
Always accompany icons with text labels to clarify their meaning and improve accessibility, especially for users who rely on screen readers.
