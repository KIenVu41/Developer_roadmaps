Understanding Type Classification

Type classification is a system for categorizing type styles, with Serif and Sans Serif being two popular classifications.
Serif typefaces are characterized by small lines called serifs extending from letter strokes, while Sans Serif typefaces lack these lines.
Choosing a Typeface

A typeface encompasses the overall style of letters, including stroke weight, shape, serif type, and line lengths, and is identified by a family name.
Examples of serif typefaces include Times New Roman, Georgia, and Cambria, while Arial, Helvetica, and Verdana are examples of sans serif typefaces.
Selecting a Font

Font refers to the size, thickness, and emphasis of letters within a typeface.
For instance, Roboto Bold in 12-point size is a font, as is Roboto Light in 18-point size, both belonging to the Roboto typeface.
