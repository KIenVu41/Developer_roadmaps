Visual Design Fundamentals

Visual design in UX focuses on a product's appearance for the user.
Key elements include typography, color, and iconography, each playing a crucial role in user experience.
Understanding Key Elements

Typography uses text and fonts to create hierarchy, readability, and visual style.
Color theory helps designers choose colors that are harmonious, complementary, and convey the right message.
Iconography uses images and symbols to represent actions or ideas, like the power button icon.
Remember, while visual design is important, usability should always be the top priority for UX designers.
