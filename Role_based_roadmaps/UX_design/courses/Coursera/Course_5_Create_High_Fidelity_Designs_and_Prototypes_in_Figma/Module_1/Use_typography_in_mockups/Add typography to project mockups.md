You’ve explored how to add typography to your design mockups in Figma. This is exciting because, as you’ve also learned, typography is a powerful design element that:

Creates hierarchy among information

Makes text accessible and easy to read

Conveys the brand associated with a product

Hierarchy, accessibility, and branding make your products more usable and meaningful for users. This review explores an example of how to maximize typography in a design. Use this review for guidance as you create and assess your project portfolio designs. The example comes from the Zia’s Pizza app:

Three Figma framesThree Figma frames: 1. Low-fidelity wireframe of a screen in Zia’s Pizza app, including “Today’s Top Pizza” section, “Add to Order” button, “Pizzas You Might Like” section, and “Build Your Own” button. 2. High-fidelity mockup of the wireframe. 3. Outline of typographic choices for the high-fidelity mockup.
Sample copy
In this example, the designer added sample copy to both the low-fi mockup on the far left and the high-fi mockup in the middle. When filling designs with sample copy, you can use 
placeholder text, like lorem ipsum,
 as well as real copy, which is the text users will see in the final product (or a version of that text). Designers often use a mixture of both placeholder text and real copy, depending on factors like how much time they have and what their stakeholders expect. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) applications are now being used to quickly generate placeholder text that simulates real copy.

Defined typography choices
Next, the designer defined their typography choices in the area to the right. You’ll notice a variety of typefaces and fonts that create hierarchy for the information in the app and express the app’s brand. With these typeface and font choices defined, the designer can quickly refer to them and replicate them consistently throughout their mockups.

Now let’s explore how the designer applied their typography choices to create hierarchy, accessibility, and branding in the mockup’s sample copy.

Typeface
First, consider the example's typefaces. Typeface is the overall style of a letter: its stroke weight, shape, type of serif, and line lengths. Typefaces fall into styles or classifications, such as serif and sans serif, and they can make text more or less appealing, attention-grabbing, and readable. 

For example, the designer chose the Permanent Marker typeface for the app’s logo. This typeface is a handwriting style of typeface. It’s dynamic and attention-grabbing, which makes it ideal for highlighting “Zia’s Pizza.” But it’s also harder to read, so the designer opted to use it only for a single, limited purpose. In contrast to the Permanent Marker typeface, the designer chose less dynamic and more readable typefaces, Oswald and Roboto, for all the other text in the app: headers, subheaders, body text, and buttons. These categories of text are more common throughout the app, so they need to be both enjoyable to look at and very easy to read.

Fonts
Second, consider the fonts. Font is a letter’s size, thickness, and emphasis. Larger and heavier fonts tend to grab more attention, while smaller and lighter fonts may be more readable in longer passages. Ideally, you should choose at least two font sizes for a product’s text: a larger size for titles and headings and a smaller size for subheadings and body text. 

In the example, for instance, the logo and header text are both in 24px while the subheadings and body text are both in 12px. Also, notice the differences in thickness that distinguish the subheadings and body text: Both are in 12px, but the subheading font is bold while the body text font is regular.

Typographic hierarchy
Together, the example’s typefaces and fonts create the app’s typographic hierarchy: visual divisions and distinctions that draw users’ attention and show them where to find different kinds of information. For example, the two headers in Oswald Semibold 24px make it easy to quickly locate and move between sections of the screen that show two different kinds of recommendations: “Today’s Top Pizza” and “Pizzas You Might Like.”

Legibility, readability, and brand guidelines
Finally, in addition to the app’s typographic hierarchy, notice how the designer used typeface and font to promote legibility, readability, and brand guidelines. Legibility refers to how easy it is to distinguish one letter from another within a particular typeface and font. Readability, a more general term, refers to how easy it is for users to read whole words and passages in a product. And brand guidelines are key for creating text that both aligns with client expectations and also expresses the brand’s identity, mission, and values. 

Below, for example, notice the excerpt from the example’s “Today’s Top Pizza” section. Here, the designer used two typefaces from the sans serif typeface classification (Oswald and Roboto) and a variety of fonts to create hierarchy: semibold 24px for the header, bold 12px for the subheader, and regular 12px for the body text. Together, these choices make the copy legible, readable, and visually consistent: In addition to being easy to read, the text looks like it’s part of a coherent and consistent brand.

Key takeaways
Now you’re ready to start adding and formatting text in your own project mockups! This is an exciting step in bringing your product to life and moving closer to a high-fi prototype that simulates the product’s final look, feel, and brand.
