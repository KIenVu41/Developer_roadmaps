You've started to learn about what's involved in adding typography to your designs, like picking a typeface and choosing a font. By now, you know that type is an important design choice. When typography complements a design’s personality and style, it helps convey a brand's identity, values, and mission. It can also add emphasis to parts of your design, which helps users find and interpret the information they need. 

In this reading, you will learn the basics of working with typography in Figma. You’ll create and select text fields, adjust fonts and font sizes, reorganize text, and set and save configured fonts. There are lots of cool features to explore when it comes to adding type to your designs in Figma, so let’s go! 

Note: Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for 
Navigating UI3: Figma’s New UI
. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being. 

Create text fields 
Before making choices about typography, you’ll need to create a text field in Figma:

Open your file in Figma.

Select the Text icon in the toolbar, which looks like a letter T (highlighted in blue in the image below).

Click anywhere on the Canvas and start typing to enter text.

Text Tool and Fonts
 tutorial video from Figma.

Select and edit text fields
To edit or adjust your text, you must first select the text box. When there is only one text box in your Canvas, you can select it with a single click. But when there are multiple boxes, you will need to select the correct layer. To select a text box:

Click the text you want to edit in the Layers panel (on the left side of the screen). The selected text layer will be highlighted in blue in the Layers panel, as shown in the image below.

Double-click the text in the box you selected on the Canvas. Or, to select all the text in a box, press enter (or return).

Make changes to the text as needed

To select more than one text box, first choose the Move tool (highlighted in the upper toolbar of the image below). Then, find an empty space on your canvas and click and drag a selection box over the text boxes you want to edit. All the text in this selection box will be highlighted in blue in the Layers panel, as shown below.

Adjust fonts and font sizes
Once you’ve selected a text box, you're ready to make design choices! You can adjust text properties like font size and weight (the thickness of your font). To adjust your font:

First, select a text box using the steps in the previous section.

Then, find the Text section of the Design panel (on the right side of the screen).

To find a typeface or font family, click the Font dropdown. From here you can browse a list of web, local, and shared fonts.

You can choose a weight from the Weight dropdown.

To change the size of the text using the Size dropdown, or manually enter a size in the size field. 

From the Text menu, you can also change properties like paragraph spacing, line height, alignment, and more. To find out more about using text to make your designs unique, check out this article from the Figma Help Center:

Reorganize text
You can adjust the alignment, size, location, or constraints of your text in the Design panel. Let’s break down the sections of this panel:

Alignment
The alignment options are located at the top of the Design panel. Alignment determines how text and other design elements are distributed inside the boundary box. Once you’ve selected a text box, you can choose from the following alignment options in the menu bar:

Align left

Align horizontal center

Align right

Align top 

Align vertical center

Align bottom 

Distribute

If you’ve selected multiple text boxes, you can click the dropdown menu, (as shown below), to choose from three more alignment options:

Tidy up: Distribute the selected elements evenly in all directions

Distribute vertical spacing: Space selected elements evenly across the height of the frame

Distribute horizontal spacing: Space selected elements evenly across the width of the frame

Location and size
The numbers below the alignment options correspond to a selected element’s position on the Canvas. By changing these numbers, you can move an element along the frame’s X axis (left and right) and the Y axis (up and down).   

You can adjust an element’s width and height using the W and H values. Keep in mind that these values only change the size of the selected text box, not the font. Changing the W and H values can be handy when you’ve resized your text and want to change the size of the box to match.

Constraints
Constraints limit where an element can be placed within a Frame. They are helpful when you need to maintain a specific distance from the edge of the canvas and for designing on different devices.

Constraint area on Figma design panel
Each element has horizontal and vertical constraints. The horizontal constraints dictate how close the element can get to along the left or right edge of the frame. The vertical constraints determine how close it can get to the  top or bottom edge. You can also decide on how to center the element on the X or Y axis. If you need to resize the frame, you can also set the scale of an element so that it  remains in proportion to the resized frame.

Set and save preconfigured fonts
As you get more comfortable with Figma, you can save time by saving a text style and reusing it across different designs:

In the Layers panel, select the text with the properties you want to save and reuse.

Go to the Text header in the Design panel. Then, click the Style icon (represented by four dots in the shape of a square).

The Text Styles will appear. Click the Plus (+) icon in the top right corner of this menu to name your style.

Once you’ve picked a name, click Create Style.And that's it! You've saved a text style to reuse again in your designs. To use a text style you've saved, select the text you want to edit in the Layers panel. Then return to the Text Styles menu to select the style you created from the list.:
