You’re almost ready to create your very first mockup in Figma. Before you get started, let’s explore some of the skills that will give you the basic foundation to confidently create mockups in Figma.

Names to know
Before you can begin creating a mockup, it’s important to understand the names that are used in Figma.

Each document is called a file. 

A file contains the canvas, where you’ll create layers and objects for your designs. 

A file also contains pages, where you’ll design your screens. 

Each page has its own canvas. This canvas is gray (#E5E5E5) by default and is where you can add, remove, and update your designs. 

Note: Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for 
Navigating UI3: Figma’s New UI
. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being. 

Create a new page
It’s easy to create a new page in Figma by following these simple steps:

Log in to Figma.

Create a new Design file by clicking the + icon in the upper-right corner.

On the left, click Page 1. This lists all of the pages currently in your file.

Click the + icon to add a new page to your file, as shown in the image below. 

When you create a new page, you’ll immediately be able to rename it. Or, you can rename a page at any time by double-clicking the title of the page. When you begin to name a page, the name text will be highlighted in blue and the row will be outlined in blue, as shown in the image below.

The new page two is highlighted in a blue box and the name text is highlighted in blue to indicate to rename it. Red arrows point to the page two labels.

Create frames
The canvas in Figma is where you’ll create frames. You can think of the canvas like a blank wall that a picture frame hangs on, and the frames are like picture frames where you’ll design.

To create a new frame: Select the frame tool. The icon has four lines crossing in a grid pattern. It’s listed as the third icon from the left in the toolbar. The image below shows the frame icon in the Figma toolbar.

There are a few ways to choose the size of the frame:

Click inside the canvas to create a default frame. The dimensions for default frames are 100x100 pixels. 

Click and drag in the canvas to create a frame with the dimensions you prefer. When you click and drag, the width and height will automatically update based on how much you drag. If you want to choose a specific width and height, you can do this in the frame section in the design panel on the right side of the screen.

Select a predetermined size for a frame, like a specific phone model or tablet, in the Design panel on the right side of the screen. As shown in the image below, there is a list of different containers or frames for various devices or formats. Simply select a size to add the frame to your canvas.

You have the tools!
You’ll use Figma or a similar design tool in your job as a UX designer. The more familiar you become with Figma and its features, the faster you’ll be able to create your own digital mockups in any tool. Remember: The knowledge you’re gaining isn’t limited to Figma. The skills you’re acquiring by working in Figma will transfer to your work in other digital tools.

Before you get to work, here’s a pro tip: It helps to open multiple windows to view your files. With multiple windows open, you can view a different file from the one you’re working in without closing your current file. To create a new window, right-click files in your "Drafts” and “Recents" folders, and select “Open in new tab.”
