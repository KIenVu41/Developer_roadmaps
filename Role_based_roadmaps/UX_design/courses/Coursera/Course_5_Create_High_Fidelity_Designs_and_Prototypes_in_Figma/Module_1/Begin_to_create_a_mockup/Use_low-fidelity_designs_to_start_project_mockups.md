You’ve learned how to 
create new pages and frames inside a file in Figma
. Creating new pages and frames is an important first step for converting low-fidelity designs into mockups and high-fidelity prototypes. Remember that mockups are static designs that show what a final product will look like. They are also the building blocks for high-fidelity prototypes. High-fidelity prototypes enable designers, stakeholders, users, and others to simulate the full experience of a final product, including its visual and interactive elements. They are crucial for getting feedback and approval on your designs.

This review briefly explores some benefits and best practices for using pages and frames in your design process. Use these best practices as you convert the low-fidelity designs for your portfolio projects into mockups for high-fidelity prototypes. Remember that you’re aiming for a portfolio of 3–5 completed projects. Pages and frames in Figma will give you neat and tidy containers in which to create, store, organize, and display your work.

Note: Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for 
Navigating UI3: Figma’s New UI
. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being. 

Pages
Pages are a great way to organize designs in Figma. Each page has its own canvas, where you can create and store different design assets or different versions of the same asset. (Design assets include wireframes, mockups, and the individual elements that make up wireframes and mockups.) With different design assets organized into their own pages, you’ll have an easier time finding important items quickly and focusing on one part of a design at a time.

For example, here is a Figma File for the design of Zia’s Pizza ordering app. On the left side of the File, notice how the designer has created two Pages: one titled Wireframes and one titled Mockups. With each page in place, the designer can quickly navigate between their lo-fi wireframes and the hi-fi mockups. The checkmark reminds them which page they’re working in.

Frames
Within the mockups page, the designer has populated the gray canvas with frames. Frames are containers for design assets. In this case, each frame will contain a mockup for one of the app screens for  Zia’s Pizza: a “Home” screen, a “Build Your Own” screen for ordering, a “Confirmation” screen for completed orders, and so on. 

Notice how the frames are numbered. These numbers indicate the sequence in which users will navigate through the screens when the screens are finally mocked up and organized into a working prototype.

And each frame is listed in the Figma file’s left-hand navigation menu, which makes it easy to navigate to different frames without having to scroll around the Canvas. Keep this feature in mind, because Figma canvases can get extra large—just like pizzas!

When you get ready to convert your wireframes into hi-fi mockups, consider organizing your own Figma file in the way you see in the example: one page for your wireframes, one page for your mockups, and individual frames for each asset you’re going to mock up.

Key takeaways
In a Figma file, each page contains a canvas where you can design and store design assets. Within a page’s canvas, frames are containers for individual design assets. As you work through the design process, consider creating different pages for related groups of design assets, such as your low-fi wireframes and high-fi mockups. Frames can be titled and numbered to indicate their position within the flow of a prototype or final product.
