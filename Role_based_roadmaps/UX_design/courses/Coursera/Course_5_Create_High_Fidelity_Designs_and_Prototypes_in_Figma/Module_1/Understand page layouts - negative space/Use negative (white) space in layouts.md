What is White Space?

In UX design, white space, often called negative space, refers to the gaps between elements in a design.
It's not necessarily white; it's just the empty space that provides visual breathing room for the user's eyes.
Why is White Space Important?

White space can emphasize focal points, group related items together (proximity), and enhance readability.
Insufficient white space can lead to user errors, like accidentally clicking the wrong button.
