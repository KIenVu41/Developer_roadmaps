In this part of the course, you've been learning about page layouts. As you begin to layout pages for the app you're designing, it can be helpful to know about common layouts and patterns that are used in existing apps. Knowing about these layouts can help kickstart your visual design process, save you time, and improve your design work.

Common screens in mobile apps
You may have noticed that mobile apps tend to have certain types of screens in common. The layout and appearance may differ between apps, but they all share the same purpose and design considerations. Below are some of the most common types of mobile app screens. Keep them in mind as you begin creating wireframes for your mobile app portfolio project.

Home screen
The home screen is the first screen users encounter when they open an app. Home screens display the app’s main content and features, and serve as a starting point for users to explore further. 

Since the home screen lets users know what an app has to offer, the content needs to be easy to understand, use, and navigate. Common navigation elements, like a bottom navigation menu and a search icon, make it easy to get started with an app because they are familiar to many users.

It can be tempting to fill a home screen with lots of content, but that can create a cluttered and overwhelming experience for users. Focusing on essential content—and making good use of white space—makes home screens easier to use.

Onboarding screens
Onboarding screens introduce first-time users to an app’s main components and functions. They can help users get started quickly, especially if an app has unique or unfamiliar features. Onboarding screens can also collect information to create a more personalized user experience. Designers have a lot of options when it comes to these screens, so they should be tailored to the experience of a particular app.

A good onboarding flow can boost user engagement and retention. But because they’re often made up of several screens, they need to be easy to navigate. Designers can minimize drop-off by using clear, concise copy and engaging graphics to create a seamless and memorable experience.

Profile/Account screen
A profile, or account, screen contains a user’s personal details (like their name and email) and their app preferences (like order history and accessibility settings). Because a profile screen contains a lot of important information, it should be clearly organized and easy to navigate. That’s why it’s a best practice to make them as simple and clean as possible.

Checkout Screen
The checkout screen is where users complete purchases. Checkout can be more complex than other parts of an app since it usually involves a few forms for payment and shipping info. This step can be stressful, so it’s important that users feel as safe as possible. Designers can help by making it clear what information is needed for each form field and adding visual cues to indicate that a field has been filled out correctly. They can also let users know their personal data is secure and include a confirmation message when a user completes a purchase successfully. 

Key Takeaways
The more you can incorporate good design practices into your wireframes, the easier the rest of the design process will be. You’ll save time and effort, leaving you space to experiment with your design ideas. We've shown you a few common examples of mobile app layouts, but there are many available options.
