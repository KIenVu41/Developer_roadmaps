Methods of Containment

Dividers and Borders: Dividers are lines that separate sections, while borders are continuous lines forming shapes like squares or rectangles, both enhancing visual organization.
Fill: Fill refers to applying colors to borders and shapes, making content stand out and creating focal points within a design.
Containment in Action

The redesigned dog walker app homepage exemplifies these methods, using dividers between dog walker profiles, a border and orange fill for the "choose-a-time" button, and a subtle shadow to add dimension.
These elements work together to create a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.
