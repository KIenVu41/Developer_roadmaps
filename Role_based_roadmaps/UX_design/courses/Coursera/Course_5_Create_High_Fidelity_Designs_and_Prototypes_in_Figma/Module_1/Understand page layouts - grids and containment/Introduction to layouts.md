What are Layouts?

Layouts involve arranging elements like text, styles, icons, and images on a page to guide the user's experience.
They ensure a design is user-friendly and helps important elements stand out.
Reusing Layouts

Common layouts exist for frequently used pages like home screens, login screens, and checkout screens.
These can be reused and adapted for different projects, saving time and effort.
