You’ve learned how to apply containment elements to your portfolio project mockups Containment uses visual barriers to keep designs neat and organized. 

You’ve also learned that there are four methods of containment:

Dividers: Lines that separate sections

Borders: Continuous lines that break up sections of a page and often form shapes, like squares or rectangles

Fill: A color feature within borders and shapes

Shadow: An effect that creates dimension, often used in combination with borders or fill

Now, you’ll review a completed  example that shows how these four methods of containment were applied to the Zia’s Pizza app. 

Evaluate the mockups in terms of containment issues

In this example, the designer started by evaluating their current design for containment issues and had these observations:

It's difficult to tell where one section ends and the next one begins. 

Due to the background color, it looks like there are two sections. In reality, however, there are three main content sections.

It is not clear that in the “Pizzas You Might Like” section, there is a button.

Apply divider lines and fills to separate sections
After evaluating this screen, the designer looked for areas where it might be helpful to separate sections or where content and elements run together. The examples below show the “before” and "after” of how dividers and fills were used to separate entire sections.

Let’s break down the changes that were made to the “after” version on the right:

A divider line is used between the top navigation bar and the content below it. 

A fill is added to one section of the background. The fill is meant to show a more permanent separation than the inset divider, which is separating different content in the same section. Adding a fill to the “Today’s Top Pizza” section helps distinguish it from the other content sections.

Add borders and shadows to form shapes
Buttons are an excellent place to start adding borders in your project mockups. A lack of borders on buttons can make it difficult for users to identify them as buttons. Notice how the example below from the Zia's Pizza app uses a border to clearly identify the component as a button.

The designer identified that the button in the “Pizzas You Might Like” section wasn’t clearly identified. To improve this, the designer added a shadow to the “Pizzas You Might Like” section, creating a border and allowing it to act like a card because it was separated from the rest of the content.

Before and after

In the "Pizzas You Might Like" section, it is unclear whether “The Incredible” is a button because it does not have a border. On the right mockup, the app is divided into sections, indicated by differing background colors. In the “Pizzas You Might Like” section, the button appears to be selectable given the drop shadow around the pizza name and price.
The designer implemented the changes as seen in the image on the right. Note the following improvements: 

It's easy to tell where one section ends and the next one begins. The three content sections are now clearly defined by the different background colors.

A divider line is placed between the current wait time and the number of pizzas in the queue to separate the content sections. 

It is clear that in the “Pizzas You Might Like” section, there is a clickable button. 

Expand use of containment elements to other screens 
Once a designer knows how and where to add containment elements to one screen, the next step is to add them consistently throughout all the other screens of the project. 

In the Zia’s Pizza example below, the designer added divider lines between the sections and also applied the same border and shadow treatment to create card layouts that are clickable.

Improve your portfolio projects by applying containment elements
When you’re ready, you can use this example as a guide to review and revise your own portfolio projects in terms of containment elements. Remember, you need to have 3–5 completed projects for your portfolio. Keep iterating and improving along the way!

Key takeaways
Use containment methods such as dividers, borders, fills, and shadows to keep designs neat and organized. 

Evaluate your designs for ways to contain elements and keep content and interactions more organized.

Refine designs in one screen by adding dividers, borders, fills, and shadows to help separate content into logical sections and identify buttons and other important objects.

Implement the same changes in all other screens.
