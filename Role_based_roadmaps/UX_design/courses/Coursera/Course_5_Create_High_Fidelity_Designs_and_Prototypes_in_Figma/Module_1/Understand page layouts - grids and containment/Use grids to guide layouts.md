Grid Types and Their Uses

Basic grids use evenly spaced intersecting lines to divide a page into squares, aiding in consistent element placement.
Layout grids, more commonly used in UX design, employ columns and alleys to structure content, adapting to different screen sizes.
Benefits and Practical Application of Grids

Grids bring clarity and consistency to designs, guiding the user's eye and making content easier to scan.
They expedite the design process, facilitate collaboration, and can be reused across different projects, as illustrated by the "Peacock" app example.
