Grids are a helpful and practical tool to use as you create designs. Grids give consistency and structure to your design, and they help ensure that your designs fit within the screen boundaries. 

Basic grid and Layout grid examples on Figma
Remember, a basic grid has intersecting lines that divide pages into small squares that allow you to easily lay out elements in a design. If you used grid paper to draw your wireframes, a basic grid will look familiar! A basic grid is on the left in the image above.

Basic grids are useful to help you design consistently, but UX designers more commonly use layout grids. A layout grid is a series of columns and alleys that allow you to organize elements in a design. Columns are the colored blocks, and alleys are the uncolored spaces between the columns. A layout grid is shown on the right in the image above. 
 
You can also apply more than one grid to a frame and edit them separately. So let's explore how to use grids in Figma!

Note: Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for 
Navigating UI3: Figma’s New UI
. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being. 

Create and apply grids 
To apply a layout grid to your designs in Figma:

Select the Frame in the Layers panel or on the canvas. If you're working on a file you've already started designing, be sure that you’re selecting the Frame and not another element’s layer by accident. 

On the right side of the screen is the Properties panel. In the Layout grid section, click the + icon.

By default, a basic grid, which Figma calls a Uniform Grid, will be applied to the Frame. Uniform grid gets it's name because all of the squares in the grid are a uniform size.

You can update the properties by clicking on the icon with nine squares, in the shape of a square, to the left of Grid to open the Layout grid settings.

Align the elements to a grid
A control is a feature that helps you align design elements. In Figma, controls are located at the top of the Properties panel. Aligning the elements on your Frame to a grid will help your layout appear even, organized, and "tidy," as Figma describes it. 

Here are the controls in Figma, in the order listed below:

Align horizontal centers

Align right

Align top

Align vertical centers

Distribute horizontally

Distribute vertically

Tidy up

Auto Layout
Another feature in Figma that you might want to use when creating mockups is Auto Layout. With Auto Layout, your designs can shrink or grow in response to a change. For example, you can create buttons that grow or shrink as you edit their text label. 

There are a few ways you can add Auto Layout, such as:

Select a frame, then click the plus (+) icon next to Auto Layout in the right sidebar.

Right-click the frame or object, then select Add Auto Layout.

Use the keyboard shortcut Shift + A.
