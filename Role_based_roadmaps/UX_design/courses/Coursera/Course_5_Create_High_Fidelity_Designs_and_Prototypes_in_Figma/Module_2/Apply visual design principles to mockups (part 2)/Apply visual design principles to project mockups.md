At this point, you’ve applied a number of refinements to your mockup, and you’ve been tasked with prioritizing user needs in your design decisions. Next, you will focus on finding opportunities to improve the usability of your design. 

You’ve already learned about the visual design principles: 

Emphasis: Make certain elements stand out from others around them in your design. Apply greater visual weight to what you want the user to notice first to help them complete their task.

Hierarchy: Assign prominence to elements that contain important information. The sizing of elements is a great place to start when refining visual hierarchy.

Scale and proportion: Use the size of elements to show where they are relatively similar or different.

Unity and variety: Make sure that your design is unified as a whole, but includes enough variety throughout to break up the monotony.

Providing more clarity around the most important actions a user can take while keeping in mind the overarching user intent will increase the usability of your product.

Now, you’ll review an example to see how a designer applied all four visual design principles to the Zia’s Pizza app.

Evaluate the design in terms of visual design principles

The designer started by evaluating the current design based on the four principles of visual design, and they had the following observations:

Emphasis: The “Pizzas You Might Like” section needs more visual emphasis

Hierarchy: The information about wait time and number of pizzas in the queue needed to be more prominent 

Scale and proportion: Some of the text is small and hard to read.

Unity and variety: The variety of color is working well

Refine the visual design
The designer then applied changes based on their observations.    

Emphasis 
The designer used emphasis in the “Pizzas You Might Like” section by placing the item in an elevated box and adding a photo in the box. This emphasis helps clarify that the information belongs to that specific pizza.

Hierarchy 
The information about wait time and number of pizzas in the queue needed to be more prominent, so the designer reworked the layout of the elements.

Scale and proportion 
In the same example above, in the before image on the left, the text related to wait time and number of pizzas in the queue is small and hard to read, and the red button is large and stands out. In the example on the right, the larger red text helps to balance the proportions.

Unity and variety 
The variety of colors was working well. The variety of color fills helped guide the information architecture, while the consistent color palette worked to keep the overall look unified. 

Before and after

Improve your portfolio projects by applying visual design principles
When you’re ready, you can use this example as a guide to review and revise your own portfolio projects in terms of these four visual design principles. Remember, you need to have 3–5 completed projects for your portfolio. Keep iterating and improving along the way!

Here are some tips for completing this step:

On a screen you’ve identified as needing refinement, find two instances where you could apply visual design principles, and implement them. 

Remember the specific principles you’ve applied already, and repeat this process for all of your mockup screens. 

Make sure that you apply all four of the principles you’ve learned about at least once. These decisions and refinements are not set in stone.

If you’re looking for inspiration, browse through some of your favorite apps to understand how they apply these four visual design principles. Visual design is a challenging skill to master, but you’re officially on your way! 

Key takeaways
Look for opportunities to improve the usability of your design by applying the four visual design principles in your work:

Apply greater emphasis and visual weight to elements that are important to a user.

Use visual hierarchy to assign prominence to elements that contain important information. The sizing of elements is a great place to start when refining visual hierarchy.

Use scale and proportion to highlight similarities and differences.

Check for the right balance of unity and variety to create consistency while avoiding monotony.
