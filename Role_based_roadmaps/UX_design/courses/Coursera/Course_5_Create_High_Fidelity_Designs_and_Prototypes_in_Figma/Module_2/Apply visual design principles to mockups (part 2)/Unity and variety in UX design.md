Unity in Design

Unity is about creating a sense of cohesion and consistency in your design.
This can be achieved through a consistent color scheme, complementary fonts, and consistent spacing.
Variety in Design

Variety is about adding visual interest and breaking up monotony in your design.
This can be achieved by using different shapes, colors, textures, and patterns.
Balancing Unity and Variety

A good design uses both unity and variety in a balanced way.
Too much unity can be boring, while too much variety can be chaotic.
