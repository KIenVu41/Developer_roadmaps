What is Hierarchy?

Hierarchy is a visual design principle that organizes elements on a page based on their importance, guiding the user's attention.
It uses visual cues like size and color to distinguish important elements, helping users understand where to focus first.
Hierarchy in UX Design

In UX design, hierarchy ensures users can easily navigate an app and find relevant information quickly.
It guides users through their journey, highlighting the most important actions and information.
Impact on Accessibility

Hierarchy is crucial for accessibility, especially for users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.
Accessibility annotations in mockups can further enhance hierarchy, indicating the order in which elements should be read or interacted with.
