What is Emphasis?

In simple terms, emphasis means making something stand out and attract attention.
In visual design, we use emphasis to guide the user's eye to what's most important on a page or screen.
How to Create Emphasis

You can create emphasis by giving elements more visual weight.
Visual weight can be adjusted through properties like size, color, and contrast. For example, a large, orange button will stand out more than a small, gray one.
