Now that you’ve learned about standard design principles like emphasis, hierarchy, and proportion, it’s time to consider some additional design elements. As you continue to develop high-fidelity designs, you will focus more on visuals, aesthetics, and functionality. This reading will explore how to use visual elements like value, saturation, and orientation to enhance the user experience. 

Value. A bar that moves from zero percent black to one hundred percent black. 
While Hue refers to color families (like red, green, or blue), Value is a color’s lightness or darkness. The lightest value of any color is white and the darkest is black (as in the graphic above). Many programs have value settings, like a sliding scale that lets you add white or black to a selected color. Value is key to creating contrast in your designs. For example, a color with a lighter value stands out against a dark background, which can make a design easier to see.

Saturation. An image of a panel of colors that moves from a low saturation grayish red to a high saturation bright red.
Saturation refers to the intensity and richness of color. Think of the highest saturation as the purest form of a color. For example, red, at its most saturated, is bold and bright. You can soften pure red by lowering the saturation and making it appear more muted. Lowering the saturation all the way would leave you with shades of grey, like a black and white film.

The saturation you choose depends on how bold you want the colors in your design to be. Highly saturated colors are great for grabbing a user's attention. Think of neon signs, highlighters, and sirens—all of which use intense saturation to emphasize their importance.

"Orientation", and then an icon of a monitor, phone held horizontally, and vertically, all showing the Google logo
Orientation refers to the layout of your design. Orientation often corresponds with the platform or device you are designing for. For example, desktop computers tend to have horizontal (or landscape) orientations, whereas mobile phones and tablets let users alternate between vertical (or portrait) and horizontal orientations. 

Some devices aren’t oriented horizontally or vertically. Smartwatches, for example, are usually square, so smartwatch app designers need to take that into account. You can think of orientation as a grid that helps you plan your designs to fit within different shapes. 

"Intrinsic interest" followed by a graphic of a page of a book showing letters falling into a funnel, and then text.
Intrinsic interest refers to how eye-catching a visual element is to users. Certain design elements, like logos or animations, are meant to grab a user’s attention. For example, in the image above, the chapter title is big and bold, drawing the reader’s focus. The text of the chapter, on the other hand, is smaller and more readable. 

The graphic on the left side of the image uses variations in color, scale, and composition, which makes it stand out even more than the chapter title. The image of the funnel also helps draw the user’s attention because images are generally more eye-catching than text.

You can use intrinsic interest in your designs by making sure the most important elements stand out—and that the least important blend in. For example, many magazines use serif fonts for article titles and sans serif fonts for body text. Serifs add flair to the titles that distinguish them from the rest of the content.

"Perceived physical weight" followed by graphic of a phone using a cooking app
Perceived physical weight is the illusion of weight and volume that each visual element conveys. When creating elements that simulate objects with physical weight, you’ll want each element’s dimensions to proportionately relate to the others. 

In the graphic above, each container appears to hold a different volume of liquid, from a measuring cup to a milk jug. The relative sizes of the containers range from small and light to big and heavy. It’s the difference between a single serving and enough for a crowd!

Enrich the user's journey
Choosing different visual elements allows you to create more interesting, appealing, and usable designs. As you continue your design journey, remember that each element can enrich the user’s experience and interactions with your products. Take the time to map out your visual choices and your reasons for choosing them. In UX design, there are no coincidences!
