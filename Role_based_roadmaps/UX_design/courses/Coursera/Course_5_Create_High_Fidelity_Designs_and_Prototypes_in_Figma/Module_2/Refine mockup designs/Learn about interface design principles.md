Now that you’ve learned more about using visual design principles like emphasis, hierarchy, scale and proportion, unity and variety, and Gestalt Principles in your mockups, you can start to think about how you are going to implement these into your product design.

As you begin designing your product’s user interface, remember that the end goal of your design is to create usable experiences for your users. Well-designed UI supports better user navigation which can improve a user’s flow through the product you’re designing. Ask yourself if the UI elements you are thinking of using will help bring your users closer to their goal.
