In this part of the course, you've been refining your mockups based on design principles. There's one more thing to consider when creating mockups: The navigation that will help users move through the app.  

Designing your product with a simple, intuitive navigation system is essential for providing a good user experience. Think about a time when you tried to use an app or a website with navigation that was confusing or difficult to follow. It was probably a pretty frustrating experience, right?

In this reading, you’ll learn about different types of navigation and explore ways to create designs with solid, effective navigation. So let’s get started!

Types of navigation
There are a few common types of navigation you can use in your own designs: navigation bars, tab bars, navigation menus, and navigation hubs. Let’s explore each one of these.

Navigation bar

Navigation bars display the navigation links to the most important pages of the product in a single bar along one area of the screen. Depending on the design, this bar can be horizontal or vertical. Navigation bars are easy to find and give users a clear look at all of the areas of the website that they can interact with. This helps your users get exactly where they want to go. For basic websites, like a portfolio, it’s more beneficial to have a simple navigation bar for potential employers to browse. In the example, from Googler Lisa's Lucere app design, the navigation bar runs along the top of the screen for easy navigation and makes it clear which pages the user can choose from the navigation bar.

Tab bar

Tab bars are very similar to navigation bars, but they display page links as tabs that can be clicked on and off. Tab bars can be icons, they can be text, or they can be both. As you think about your own designs, know that tab bars are a great way to sort out your content and keep the user engaged with the content on your site. In the example, from Googler Kartik's Google Clock app design, the tab bar runs along the top of the screen. Each option changes within that area of the app, but doesn’t change the main screen of the app. The user can know which tab they’re on based on the highlighting and underline below the name and icon.

Navigation menu

A navigation menu is a menu that appears when the user clicks the three lines icon on the edge of the screen. These are sometimes called “hidden” menus (because they can be hidden away again) or “hamburger” menus (because of their shape). These menus are usually located at the top left or right of the screen and are easy for users to quickly locate. They also make the screen appear more visually appealing by “hiding” the details of the menu until the user taps to open it. A navigation menu is a great way to showcase all of the links that you want to include without having to make them fit within your design parameters. 

Here’s a resource from Enginess that explains the benefits and drawbacks of navigation menus and how and when to include them in your product:

Navigation hub

Finally, a navigation hub displays a collection of links on the homepage of the website. With a navigation hub, the user often has to go back to the homepage to change pages. This format helps reduce the amount of content on the screen at one time. There is often a visible back button on each page that takes you back to the homepage where all of the navigation links are located. A navigation hub might be ideal for you if your designs don’t have a lot of pages but, if your users need to multitask and move from one page to another, a navigation hub might not be the best option. On Googler 
Tongfang’s portfolio website
, each page only has a few options to view before users have to go back to the homepage to change pages.

Navigational design elements
Navigation organizes information so users can interact with other parts of a product. Navigation design is made up of elements, like buttons and icons, that create a clear, easy path for users so they can reach their goal. How can you use buttons and icons in your navigation?

Buttons: These can be fully designed buttons or clickable elements, like text or icons. Buttons might be animated to look clickable or have a line underneath them to show their interactivity. 

Icons: Icons are like visual shortcuts for the brain. Common icons include an envelope icon that represents an email inbox, a house icon that takes the user to the homepage, or a social media website's logo that takes users to a social media page. 

These navigation elements are considered affordances. An affordance is a visual cue of an object’s purpose within an interface. They “afford” you the opportunity to perform an action by providing you with hints about their context. Affordances are an important part of creating effective navigation. For example, if your button is just text on the page, a user needs an affordance of some kind to know that that text is interactive.
