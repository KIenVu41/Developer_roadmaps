You’ve been exploring how to apply visual design principles, including Gestalt Principles, to mockups. As a reminder, Gestalt Principles describe how humans subconsciously make sense out of things they see. These principles include:

Similarity: Elements that appear similar (in shape, size, or color, for instance) are perceived to have the same function. 

Proximity: Elements that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart. 

Common region: Elements located within the same closed area are perceived to be grouped together.

After applying other visual design principles, designers apply Gestalt Principles to further simplify their design’s user flow and create products that are easier to use.

Now, you’ll review an example of an app mockup that applies these three Gestalt Principles. When you’re ready to apply Gestalt Principles to your own project portfolio mockups, you can use this example for reference and comparison. Remember that your project portfolio should include 3–5 complete design projects.

Gestalt Principles in action

In the example above, the designer applied visual design and Gestalt Principles to the Zia’s Pizza app’s design. Focusing on the specific process of customizing a pizza, the designer leveraged Gestalt Principles throughout. 

Similarity
As a reminder, similarity means that elements that look alike (in shape, size, or color, for instance) are perceived to have the same function. In the following image, for example, many users will perceive the circle items as having the same function because they are the same shape, size, and color. The same goes for the square items.

In the Zia’s Pizza mockup example, the principle of similarity was applied to the Toppings elements, which are all similar in terms of their size, shape, containment, typography, types of images, and other features. The designer chose to change the Crust and Sauce elements to a carousel design, to differentiate them from the toppings section. This choice reflects how Crust and Sauce are single-choice elements, whereas the user can select multiple toppings. 

Common region
Recall that the principle of common region means that elements located within the same closed area are perceived to be grouped together. In the following example, many users will perceive the items on the left as a related group and the items on the right as a related group. Each group of items occupies a distinct common region.

In the Zia’s Pizza mockup above, common region was applied to separate the similar but distinct sections of the pizza customization process: Crust, Sauce, and Toppings. 

Proximity
Finally, remember that proximity means that elements that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart. In the image below, for instance, consider the smaller, light-gray boxes on the bottom and the larger, dark-gray box on the top. Because of the principle of proximity, users will typically perceive the smaller, light-gray boxes as related to each other and distinct from the larger gray boxes above them.

In the Zia’s Pizza mockups, proximity was used to reinforce similar items like Toppings and give more space to the dissimilar items like Sauce and Crust.

How to refine your design
When designers polish or finalize mockups, they often apply the Gestalt Principles listed above to refine the decisions they’ve already made. Gestalt Principles may not be applicable on every single screen of a mockup. However, throughout a product’s main user flow, it shouldn’t be hard to find places to apply all three principles at least once. 

These decisions and refinements are not final. They can change as a project progresses. Professional designers routinely change their design decisions based on new ideas and feedback from users, stakeholders, and others.

When you apply Gestalt Principles to your mockups, think about times where you’ve consciously or subconsciously seen Gestalt Principles at work. For example, consider how a grocery store organizes its products. Examples are all around you!

Key takeaways
Gestalt principles are a useful tool you can use to help your user draw important associations and relationships between elements in your design. These principles create important distinctions between parts of your design so that it’s clear what things should be grouped together.
