What is a Usability Study?

It involves observing participants as they interact with a product prototype to see how easily they can complete tasks.
These studies provide insights that UX designers use to improve their designs.
Types of Usability Studies & When To Conduct Them

There are two types: moderated (guided in real-time) and unmoderated (participants test on their own).
You can conduct multiple usability studies throughout the design process, as the product evolves.
Important Considerations

Around five participants are a good starting point for a usability study.
Conducting studies earlier in the design process is generally more cost-effective.
