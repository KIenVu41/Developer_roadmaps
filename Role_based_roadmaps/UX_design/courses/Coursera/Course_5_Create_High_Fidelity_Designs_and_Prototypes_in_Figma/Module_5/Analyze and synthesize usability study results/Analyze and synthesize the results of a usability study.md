You’ve learned how to use affinity maps (or affinity diagrams) to synthesize findings from  usability studies and generate actionable insights for updating your designs. This process is crucial for making your products more usable, enjoyable, and meaningful. And affinity maps make excellent additions to design presentations and portfolios because they: 

Show your ability to generate actionable insights from usability research

Help you justify your design decisions with evidence about users’ experiences

Now, you’ll review an example of this process in action. You don’t have to do this process for your portfolio project now. But this review will be a helpful guide whenever you’re ready to synthesize the results of a usability study and create actionable insights for updating your designs.

Review research findings
When designers generate insights from their usability studies, they typically start by reviewing their study’s findings.

For example, consider the usability study for the Zia’s Pizza app you’ve been exploring. In that study, the designer recorded 13 types of observations about each of the study’s five participants. The following is a list of those observation types grouped into three categories:

Opinion of the app, including whether the user:

Likes the app overall

Likes the delivery system

Experience with completing prompts, including whether the user:

Knows how to get started with selecting a pizza

Has trouble building a pizza

Finds all the desired toppings to build a pizza

Has trouble selecting toppings and confirming in the app

Has trouble completing an order before checkout

Has trouble entering payment information

Attitude about the app and completing prompts, including whether the user:

Speaks in a positive tone

Speaks in an indifferent tone

Speaks in a frustrated tone

Speaks in an annoyed or impatient tone

Speaks in a confident tone

The following spreadsheet shows the raw data of the designer’s findings. 

Zia’s Pizza app usability study spreadsheet.Observation types listed vertically down the leftmost column: one type per row. Participants listed horizontally across the top row: one participant per column. Under each participant, a number 1 indicates a positive response to observation type. Example: Under Participant A, a 1 appears next to Likes the app overall to indicate Participant A likes the app overall.
Synthesize research findings with affinity mapping
After reviewing their usability study data, designers typically take the study’s findings, place those findings on cards or sticky notes, and then add those notes to an affinity map. Affinity maps are great tools for visualizing findings so you can identify common themes and generate insights based on those themes. To create them, designers often use:

Physical whiteboards or cork boards

 Note.ly 

Add findings to sticky notes
Consider how the Zia’s Pizza designer created sticky notes for their study’s findings. On each sticky note, the designer summarized their findings about all five participants for each observation type. For example, on the note for the first observation type, Likes the app overall, the designer recorded that 4 out of 5 participants liked the app overall.

Pink sticky notes showing two resultsPink sticky notes showing two results: 1. Likes the app overall: 4 out of 5 participants. 2. Likes the delivery system: 3 out of 5 participants. Blue sticky notes showing six results: 1. Knows how to get started with selecting a pizza: 5 out of 5 participants. 2. Finds all the desired toppings to build a pizza: 2 out of 5 participants. 3. Has trouble building a pizza: 3 out of 5 participants. 4. Has trouble selecting toppings and confirming in the app: 4 out of 5 participants. 5. Has trouble completing an order before checkout: 4 out of 5 participants. 6. Has trouble entering payment information: 2 out of 5 participants. Green sticky notes showing five results: 1. Speaks in a positive tone: 2 out of 5 participants. 2. Speaks in an indifferent tone: 1 out of 5 participants. 3. Speaks in a frustrated tone: 3 out of 5 participants. 4. Speaks in an annoyed or impatient tone: 1 out of 5 participants. 5. Speaks a confident tone: 2 out of 5 participants.
Sort sticky notes by similarity
Once the designer has converted their findings into sticky notes, they can move the notes around and group them. There’s no one right way to do this, but the designers goal should always be the same: to identify similarities between findings and group them accordingly. During this process, designers typically find it helpful to:

Label large groups

Search for smaller sets in larger groups

Take a break if they feel stuck

In the Zia’s Pizza affinity map, the designer grouped their notes into three areas, each with its own title and focus: Says, Does, and Feels.

The Says area includes all the notes about things users said during the study, such as “Speaks in a positive tone” (2/5 participants).

The Does area includes all the notes about things users did during the study, such as “Has trouble building a pizza” (3/5 participants).

The Feels area includes all the notes about things users felt during the study, such as “Likes the delivery system” (3/5 participants).

The following is the Zia’s Pizza affinity map:

Identify themes in the data
After designers populate an affinity map with notes, they can start identifying themes. In this part of the process, experienced designers try to: 

Keep the themes simple, direct, and easy to understand 

Limit themes to just one idea 

Remove opinions from the process and ensure that their themes are based on objective observations 

In the Zia’s Pizza affinity map, the designer made it easy to identify themes by formatting each note the same way. At the top of each note is the observation. At the bottom is the number of users who shared that observation. This format helps the designer quickly identify how common a specific observation was among all five participants.

For example, the same number of participants, 4 out of 5, seemed to have trouble selecting toppings and completing an order. Also, 3 out of 5 participants had trouble building a pizza. Together, these patterns point to an important theme: a possible problem with the overall “Build Your Own” pizza flow. 

If you are working through this process for one of your own designs, you can organize your themes by adding them to the pattern identification template, which reads as follows: 

It was observed that [number] out of [number] participants [insert observation from research]. This means that [insert theme based on that observation].

Expand themes into insights
From the common themes of an affinity map, designers often derive actionable insights for improving their designs. Strong insights should:

Be grounded in real data

Answer the usability study’s research questions 

Be easy to understand

Increase empathy for the user experience 

Inspire direct action

If you are working through this process for one of your own designs, you can further organize your insights by adding them to the insight identification template, which reads as follows: 

Based on the theme that [theme from previous analysis], an insight is [insight derived from theme].

For example, the following are the insights the Zia’s Pizza designer identified from their themes:

Based on the theme that users have trouble selecting toppings, an insight is: Add an “X” over each selected ingredient to indicate that users have an option to remove a topping after it has been selected. 

Based on the theme that users had trouble building a pizza, an insight is: Scale down the size of the pizza plate image in the “build your own pizza” user flow. 

Based on the theme that users struggled with completing an order, an insight is: Add in a “continue browsing” call-to-action button at the end of an order to allow users to add more items if they would like to.

The designer now has insights for improving their designs. Notice how these insights are:

Straightforward and easy to understand 

Grounded in real data from the usability study

Focused on empathizing with users’ needs

They are also actionable. They point to specific, relevant, and measurable changes the designer can make in their design. Now, it's time for the designer to decide what insights they want to prioritize and apply.  

Prioritize research insights from the most urgent to the least urgent
Now that the designer has done their affinity mapping, identified themes, and expanded their themes into insights, it’s time to come up with some actionable design tasks. 

The designer considers how to prioritize the insights using the following guidelines: 

Priority 0 (P0)—The most urgent label that indicates there was a significant roadblock that must be fixed for your product to work. For example, were there any parts of the user flow that prevented the user from completing their task or were difficult to access? Accessibility issues generally rank as P0.

Priority 1 (P1)—Insights that do not prevent the user from accomplishing their primary task, but would likely improve the user’s overall experience. 

Priority 2 (P2)—The least urgent insights that would make the most sense to address after all the P0 and P1 insights have been accounted for. These insights might even make more sense to address in another phase of the project.

Compile prioritized insights
The designer records their rankings in the prioritized insights template by adding their P0, P1, and P2 items in the sections provided in the template.

Since all three of the insights for the Zia’s Pizza app included elements that made it difficult for users to complete the task, they were all labeled as P0s. These insights can inspire direct action to improve the product.

If you are working through this process for one of your own designs, you can use the template to help move your insights to actionable design tasks.

Please note, when using your own prioritized insights, it is recommended to note at least 1–2 specific actionable steps you can take to refine your design. This template has room for more insights in each category than are required; make edits to your copy to suit your needs.  

Add to the case study
After the designer synthesizes their research and identifies actionable insights, it’s time to add information about the second usability study conducted to their portfolio case study slide deck!

Here’s the updated slide #15 for Zia’s Pizza: 

Slide from case study presentation with usability study findings—round one findings for wireframes to mockups includeUsers want to be able to order pizza more quickly, have more customization options, and add a delivery option. Round two findings informed the high-fidelity prototype: Users want fewer steps in the checkout process and improvements to the "Build Your Own" functionality.

Key takeaways
Synthesizing data from research is vital to the UX process. The data from the study is only valuable for UX designers if they can use the data to figure out creative ways to improve on their designs. Going through several rounds of testing and iterating throughout a project is an important part of the design process. 

When you’re ready to synthesize data for your own project, you can use this review as a guide. When you’re done, check your work using this list of reminders.

Did you remember to:

Compile all the raw data from the note-taking spreadsheet?

Create an affinity map by converting each participant observation into a sticky note?

Organize the sticky notes by 1) type of observation and 2) how many participants matched each observation?

Study the number of similar participant responses to create your groups?

Analyze the groupings to identify themes?

Use the insight identification template to convert those themes into actionable insights?

Label each insight with priority levels so you could make changes to your design?

Identify at least one to three actionable design items that were P0?

Now you’re ready to use these insights to go back to the high-fidelity prototype and continue to iterate on the design. And then, you can decide if you want to prepare for another round of testing.
