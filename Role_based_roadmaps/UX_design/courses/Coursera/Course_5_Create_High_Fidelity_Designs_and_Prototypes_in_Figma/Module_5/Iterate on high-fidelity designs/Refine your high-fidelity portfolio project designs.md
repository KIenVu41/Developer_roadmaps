You’ve learned how to build a high-fidelity prototype, test it with a usability study, and make updates to your designs in Figma based on feedback from participants. These iterative stages of designing, testing, and refining help designers create the best possible products for users. They also help designers create portfolios that will appeal to prospective UXD employers, who typically value designers’ ability to improve designs through iteration.

Now, you’ll review an example of how designers typically update their designs based on user feedback from usability studies. This review will cover how to:

Select research insights to incorporate into designs

Update designs based on those insights

You don’t have to refine the high-fidelity designs for your portfolio project right now. But when you’re ready, this review will help you:

Determine which research insights to apply to your designs based on priority

Update your designs based on P0 and P1 insights (P2 insights are optional)

Update your high-fidelity prototype to reflect changes made to your design 

Explore the example
In the following example, the Zia’s Pizza app designer updated their high-fidelity mockups for the app’s Current order and Checkout screens. The original and updated mockups appear on a presentation slide that the designer created to showcase their updates during a client presentation. On the left side of the slide, notice how the designer describes their updates and justifies them with insights from their usability study. The designer writes:

The second usability study revealed frustration with the checkout flow. To streamline this flow, I consolidated the “Current order” and “Checkout” screens to one “Order summary” screen. I also added the pickup or delivery option to this screen.

These design updates are insight-driven: they stem directly from user insights that the designer found during their second usability study. The following are a set of steps that designers typically take to arrive at insight-driven updates like these. 

Step 1: Determine which research insights to incorporate into the design
Review and prioritize research insights
To start, designers typically review the themes and insights from whichever usability study they’re applying to their designs. Next, they prioritize these insights from most to least urgent. It’s most helpful to identify these priorities in collaboration with at least a couple of stakeholders in the project, such as fellow designers, project managers, and engineering leads. These stakeholders typically approach the process with their own priorities and perspectives, so experienced designers prepare beforehand to advocate for those usability insights they believe are most important. 

Identify Priority Zero insights
Next, designers typically identify Priority Zero, or P0, insights. These are insights that must be addressed in order for the product to:

Function properly

Avoid making users feel misled or tricked

Be accessible to users with different needs

Put another way, P0 insights are those insights that reveal fundamental roadblocks to an easy, enjoyable, and meaningful user experience. Experienced designers prioritize these insights above all others so that users of all abilities, backgrounds, and experiences can use the product to achieve their goals.

Identify Priority One and Priority Two insights
Once they've identified the most urgent insights to address, designers typically have some other insights that don't fit the criteria for a P0 insight. These additional insights may be separated into buckets based on priority: Priority One (P1) and Priority Two (P2). 

For an example of a P1 insight, consider the dog-walking app you’ve been exploring alongside the Zia’s Pizza app example. During a usability study for the dog-walking app, several users asked if it would be possible to create a recurring dog-walking appointment. This request is a perfect example of a P1 insight: On one hand, a recurring appointments feature would likely improve users’ overall experience. On the other hand, the absence of this feature doesn’t prevent users from accomplishing their primary task. This means the insight doesn’t qualify as P0. Instead, it’s a great P1 insight. It can be added to a prototype to be tested in a future research study. 

P2 insights are any insights that can be addressed after all the P0 and P1 insights have been implemented in the design. These insights might make more sense to address in a later sprint of the project. For an example of P2 insight, consider the mockup of the new Order Summary screen that the designer created after their second usability study. Now imagine that study revealed that users would prefer the Pickup and Delivery buttons be rearranged so the Delivery button appears on the left and Pickup on the right. The delivery option, users suggested, is more popular and so should appear to the left where it is more prominent. This is a good example of a P2 insight: the resulting change would address user preferences and enhance the overall user experience, but it’s a change that can safely be saved for a later phase of the design process. 

Step 2: Update designs based on insights from research 
Create an action plan 
Before updating their designs, designers typically pause to ensure they have a clear plan of action. This step is especially important if there’s a long gap between prioritizing insights and implementing them. Remember, designers first make updates based on their P0 insights. Then, they implement their P1 insights and, if they have time, their P2 insights. Designers typically aim to test their P0 and P1 updates quickly so they can understand what further updates need to be made (if any).

Update mockups and prototype based on insights 
Next, designers implement their insights and update their hi-fi mockups. Then, they update their overall prototype by:

Making any necessary changes to the order of their mockup screens

Connecting those screens in the right navigational flow

When implementing usability insights, designers don’t always change the navigational flow of their screens. But it’s still a good practice to check that all the screens are arranged in the correct order and linked to form a prototype with the right navigational flow.

If you’re making design updates as you follow along with this review, you can revisit the

 activity for a refresher on how to connect the screens in your prototype. 

Add examples to case studies or portfolios
Once they finish updating their hi-fi prototypes, designers often pause to add their work to places where they’ll display it to important audiences. This might mean adding examples of their updates to client presentation slides, like the one you explored at the beginning of this review. It might also mean adding examples to their design portfolios.

When you update your hi-fi mockups and prototypes, you’ll be almost finished with your first portfolio project. Congratulations! Be sure to add your updated designs to your portfolio case study slide deck.

You don’t have to update your case study slide deck now, but when you’re ready, the following are some steps you can follow:

On slides #17 and #18, add screenshots that demonstrate how you iterated on your designs. Choose one screen of your app to showcase on each slide, and highlight the changes you made to your designs with a before and after. 

On slide #19, choose four main screens you’d like to display. Screenshot each mockup and add the screenshots to the slide. 

On slide #20, add a screenshot of your prototype connections or a GIF of the primary user flow. You should also include a link to view your prototype—and make sure the access is set so that anyone with the link can view it.

On slide #21, include at least two accessibility considerations you applied in your designs. These might include considerations about color combinations, gestures and motions, or the inclusion of icons and imagery.

In an upcoming course item, you’ll review these steps in more detail and explore an example of a completed case-study slide deck for the Zia’s Pizza app.

A final example
Now that you’ve reviewed how to prioritize and implement research insights, consider the following working prototype of the pizza-building and checkout processes in the Zia’s Pizza app: 

GIF of working hi-fi Zia’s Pizza app prototype: Cursor appears on app home screen and selects Build Your Own button.Build Your Own pizza menu screen appears. Cursor selects items from menu and selects Add to Order button. Your Order Has Been Added screen appears. Cursor selects Go to Checkout. Order Summary screen appears. Cursor selects Add Payment Details button. Payment and Pickup screen appears. Cursor adds payment and pickup information and selects Checkout button. Checkout screen appears. Cursor selects Complete Order button. Your Order Has Been Submitted notification appears.
This hi-fi prototype showcases the priority updates that stemmed from the designer’s second usability study. These updates include streamlining the checkout process and making the “Build Your Own Pizza” feature clearer and easier to use. After making these improvements, the designer made sure to connect all the mockup screens to reflect their changes in a working hi-fi prototype.
