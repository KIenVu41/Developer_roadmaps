As you’ve learned throughout the certificate program, the UX design process is iterative, which means you’ll rework your designs as you gather more feedback to better address users' needs. But at some point, you have to consider your designs as final and hand them off to an engineering team.

You might notice that the icons in these pages look slightly different from the ones shown in the demo video. These icons are from a shareable sticker sheet that is publicly available and undergoes regular updates. That’s one benefit of using a collaborative tool—people are constantly working to improve the designs!
