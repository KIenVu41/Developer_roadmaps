Finalizing Designs

Don't base your decision to finalize designs solely on running out of time or money. Prioritize making your designs the best they can be.
Ask yourself three key questions: Do the designs accurately reflect the user experience? Have final assets replaced placeholders? Can users understand and interact with the designs independently?
Handing Off to Engineering

Once your designs are finalized, it's time to hand them off to the engineering team for production.
It's normal to feel apprehensive about letting go, but remember that most designs evolve even after launch.
You'll become more comfortable with this process as you gain more experience in UX design.
