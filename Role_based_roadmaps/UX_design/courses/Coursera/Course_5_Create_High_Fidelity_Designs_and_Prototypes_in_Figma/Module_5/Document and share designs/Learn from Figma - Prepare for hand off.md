Collaborative Design in Figma

Figma is designed for collaboration, allowing PMs, writers, researchers, designers, and developers to work together seamlessly throughout the design process.
Sharing your work early and often encourages feedback and ensures everyone is on the same page.
Setting up Your Figma Files for Collaboration

Create custom thumbnails for your files to provide context and information at a glance, such as the project status or team members.
Invite collaborators with appropriate permissions (edit or view) based on their roles and when you need their input.
Understanding Viewer Capabilities in Figma

Viewers have limited editing capabilities but can still provide valuable feedback through comments and prototype interactions.
Developers can inspect design properties, copy code snippets, and export assets in various formats for development purposes.
