Case Study Essentials:

A case study is a summarized presentation of a design project that typically includes the project goal and objectives, your role in the project, the process your team followed, and the outcome of the project.
Recruiters and hiring managers look for case studies in portfolios to see a demonstration of the candidate's design knowledge, willingness to collaborate, and ability to see a project through from start to finish.
Creating a Strong Case Study:

Follow the order of the design process: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
Include key insights from your research activities, rather than presenting all the artifacts.
Showcase your process with clear images of your work, such as wireframes, prototypes, and final designs.
Showcasing Your Learnings:

Describe how your product's design addresses the initial problems you identified.
Include a section for key takeaways, reflecting on what you learned during the design process and what you might do differently next time.
Consider adding a link to a more detailed process deck or presentation if you have one.
