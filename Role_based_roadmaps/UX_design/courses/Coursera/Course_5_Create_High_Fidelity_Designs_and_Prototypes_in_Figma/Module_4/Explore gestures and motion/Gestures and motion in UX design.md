Gestures and Motion Defined

A gesture is any touch-based interaction a user has with a device, such as tapping, scrolling, swiping, or zooming.
Motion uses animation to bring static design elements to life, guiding the user's attention and illustrating changes in the interface.
How Gestures and Motion Work Together

A common example is the "add to cart" interaction on a mobile device. The tap is the gesture, and the animation of the cart icon changing state is the motion, providing visual feedback to the user.
Another example is the act of swiping to turn the page in an e-book. The swipe is the gesture, and the animation that simulates the page turning is the motion.
