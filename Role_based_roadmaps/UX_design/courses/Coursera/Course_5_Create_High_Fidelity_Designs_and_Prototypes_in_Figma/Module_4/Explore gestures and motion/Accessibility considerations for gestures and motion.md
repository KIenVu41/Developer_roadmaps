Provide Alternatives to Gestures

Always provide alternative ways to complete a task, ensuring accessibility for users who might not be able to perform certain gestures.
For instance, Gmail allows users to archive emails by either swiping left or selecting the archive button.
Motion Speed and Duration

Be mindful of the speed and duration of motion in your designs, as very fast or prolonged animations can be disruptive or confusing.
The W3C recommends animations to be under five seconds for accessibility.
User Control Over Motion

Empower users with the ability to control motion, such as turning off looping animations, which can be distracting.
YouTube exemplifies this by allowing users to toggle autoplay on or off.
Keep these considerations in mind as you continue your learning journey in UX design. Remember, designing for accessibility ensures inclusivity for all users!
