Note: Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for 
Navigating UI3: Figma’s New UI
. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being. 

Step 1: Login to Figma  
In the video, the instructor uses the Dog Walker app to demonstrate how to add gestures and motions in Figma. Before the instructor gets started, they login into Figma and locate their project. You can open one of your own Figma designs to follow along with these steps as well. 

Step 2: Add triggers and actions 
First, be sure the interaction menu is open. To do this, select “Prototype” in the right-hand panel. 

In Figma, the right-hand menu has a choice between “Design” and “Prototype.” “Prototype” is selected.

Locate the frame, button, or item you want to add an interaction to. If you have selected “Prototype” in the right-hand menu, you should now be able to hover over and click on the interaction options indicated by a blue plus sign on the border of the frame, button, or item. Once you click on the blue plus sign, you can then drag a blue arrow to the frame you wish the button, frame, or item to interact with. In the video (and in the picture below), the blue arrow connects the “Book Appointment” button to the next frame, the frame titled, “Book appointment.” Once the arrow is dragged and dropped, an interaction popup will appear.

The interaction panel defaults to “On tap.” In the video, the lecturer says “On click/on tap.” These are referring to the same thing in Figma. Additionally, keep in mind, you can choose from several different options in the trigger dropdown.

The instructor then opens the actions dropdown menu. He mentions that there are six different selections. You’ll notice that if you open the action dropdown in the current Figma UI, you have more than six options. In the video, the instructor selects “Navigate to,” as an action which is the default setting when you create an interaction. To learn more about interactions, triggers, and actions, you can read

.

The instructor next selects the destination for the action. For the purposes of the video and in the screenshot, the destination selected is the frame right beside the homepage - the Book Appointment frame. 


In the interaction popup, the dropdown under “Navigate to” with “Book appointment” frame is selected.

The instructor then moves on to the animation dropdown, which sits just below the “Navigate to” dropdown. He selects “Instant” in the video, though there are many different animations to choose from. 


In the interaction popup, the animation dropdown has “Instant” selected.
Step 3: Test your prototype 
After setting up triggers, actions, and animations from the interaction menu, the instructor then tests the design by clicking on the “Present” icon. 

In the navigation bar, the “present” dropdown is open, showing “Present” as selected.
On the prototype screen you’ll find the design displayed within the frame of a mobile phone. Figma defaults to this presentation mode when you design within a mobile-device-sized frame. You can now test your interaction, just as the instructor did, by clicking on the trigger you set up in your own design.

Step 4: Adjust the animation
In the video, the instructor decides to go back to the design page and change the animation from “instant” to “slide in.”  Additionally, the instructor selects the up arrow to signify the selected frame will slide up from the bottom once the button is triggered. 

In the interaction popup, “Slide in” and the up arrow are selected.
After adjusting the animation, the instructor once again navigates to the prototype screen, where he tests the change. You can do your own interaction animation testing by clicking on the “Present” icon at the top of the page in Figma.  

Step 5: Add another motion
Next the instructor covers how to add an interaction to the second page that will return to the homepage. In the video, the instructor clicks on the “X” in the top corner of the book appointment frame to add an action. He clicks on the blue “+” and drags the blue arrow from the “X” on the book appointment frame back to the homepage frame. Once again, the interaction panel instantly pops up.

The instructor then adjusts the animation dropdown from “slide in” to “slide out.” Additionally, he selects the down arrow.

From the animation dropdown, “Slide out” and the down arrow are selected.
The instructor then clicks on “Present” once more to test the action and animation he just created.

In the navigation bar, the “present” dropdown is open, showing “Present” as selected.
Step 6: Share your prototype 
The instructor ends the step-by-step guide by showing you how to share your prototype in Figma. By clicking on the “Share prototype” button while in “Present” mode, you’ll be presented with a popup. In the popup panel, you can add the email addresses of those whom you wish to share your work with. 

On the “Present page” a “Share prototype” button is selected.
