Ready to make your high-fidelity prototypes even better? Let’s discuss how sound and video can improve navigation, user engagement, and flow in your prototype. 

Sound
Sound enhances usability by giving users feedback on actions they’ve taken. It indicates what a user’s status is within the app and helps users know what they can do next. For example, users of Google Chat hear a ping that notifies them of a new message when they have the Chat window minimized or in the background.

Incorporating sound into your high-fidelity designs makes the user experience better because humans have an emotional response to sounds. Using sounds humanizes user interactions; as if the app is responding with sound to an action taken. But these sounds should add to or enhance the users’ understanding of where they are within the flow or confirm an action, like a clicking sound after a user taps a button. One sound might notify users when an action is complete or unsuccessful, like if an upload failed or a download was completed. 

In another way, if misused, sounds can also be distracting or unwelcome. Users may not want sounds when they interact with the design because it’s annoying or they’re in a location where they need the sound off. Remember that you should make it simple for users to turn off the sound if they choose not to use it.

Video
Video enhances user immersion and creates interest for users as they interact with your prototype. Netflix’s user experience is a great example of video enhancing a design. When you open Netflix, a featured tv show or movie will start to play. This choice is usually personalized to your watch history, and it encourages you to watch content that you might not have otherwise known about or expressed interest in.

Using video in your high-fidelity prototype is one way to immediately grab the user’s attention and focus it on a specific area of your app. Video adds dimension to your prototype and helps captivate users’ interest. Users are also more likely to use an app or stay on a website longer when video is incorporated.

When using video in your own designs, make sure users are able to adjust the volume, replay the video, and stop the video. Also, users should have the opportunity to auto-mute the video or stop videos from automatically replaying, if they’re uninterested in the content.

Using video and sound helps support users with accessibility challenges, too. Any videos and sounds you use should include transcripts and captions, or alternate notifications, to be accessible to all users. 

Creating a better user experience
As you design your high-fidelity prototype, take some time to think about the different types of users who will interact with your product design. Think about the possible advantages and disadvantages of using sound and video. You’re on your way to creating an enjoyable and engaging user experience!
