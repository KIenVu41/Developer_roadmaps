Prototype Setup

You can create your prototype in the same Figma file as your other design elements.
Organize your screens based on the user flow before connecting them.
Connecting Screens

Use the prototype mode to connect screens, starting with the home screen.
Click the element you want to be the hotspot, drag the arrow to the destination frame, and you've made your connection!
