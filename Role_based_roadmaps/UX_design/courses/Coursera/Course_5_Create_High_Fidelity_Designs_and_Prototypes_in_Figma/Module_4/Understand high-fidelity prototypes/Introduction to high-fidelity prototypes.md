High-Fidelity Prototypes:

Unlike mockups that focus on visual design, high-fidelity prototypes prioritize functionality, incorporating visual elements, navigation, and interaction.
They replace placeholders seen in low-fidelity prototypes with realistic content, like actual names instead of "First name, Last name."
Navigation and Interactivity:

A good navigation system ensures users can easily explore the product. High-fidelity prototypes should have clear navigation elements like buttons and icons.
Interactivity, achieved by connecting screens and adding gestures and motion, makes the prototype functional and simulates the real user experience.
Creating Connections in Figma:

Select the hotspot (e.g., button, icon) where user interaction will occur.
Connect the hotspot to the destination frame or screen using the blue plus sign.
The connection enables interaction and animation, making the prototype dynamic.
