You have learned about how to recognize implicit bias in UX design. Now, let’s take a deeper look at other biases that may come up in your UX design journey and how to limit them in your work.

The human brain is designed to make quick and effective decisions rather than stick to facts at all times. As a UX designer, it’s critical to avoid biases in your work and to make your designs inclusive for all users, but as a designer, you're also human—and humans are not immune to unconscious bias. It is important to learn about and be aware of biases as they can have a large impact on your user research and can potentially negatively influence the design of your final product. You may not be able to get rid of biases completely. But, you can be more aware of them and work to overcome them.

Bias as a concept
Biases are unreasonable and unfair distortions of judgment in favor of or against a person or thing. Biases may be favorable or unfavorable: bias in favor of or against an idea. Other words for bias may include predisposition, preconception, predilection, and partiality.

Cognitive bias in UX design
In UX design, the concept of bias is focused on the term cognitive biases. According to the Interaction Design Foundation, a cognitive bias is a systematic (non random) way in which the context affects judgment and decision-making. In other words, it's all about the framing of information. 

Types of cognitive bias
There are many types of cognitive biases in UX design, including:

Ambiguity effect bias: The tendency to choose options for which the probability of a certain outcome is known, while avoiding options for which the outcome is ambiguous or uncertain.

Clustering illusion bias: The tendency to find false patterns and trends in random information when no such patterns exist.

Confirmation bias: The tendency to interpret data in a way that supports your preexisting beliefs.

Cultural bias: The tendency to interpret words or behaviors according to one’s own cultural norms, instead of considering the words and behaviors within the context of the participants’ own culture. 

False-consensus bias: The tendency to see your own opinions and behaviors as being common, while viewing other opinions and behaviors as being uncommon.

Framing bias: The tendency to make decisions based on how the information is presented or "framed" instead of the information itself.

Fundamental attribution bias: The tendency to attribute someone's behavior to their character or personality, while downplaying the influence of situational and environmental factors.

Hindsight bias: The tendency to believe that past events were more easily predictable than they were.

Implicit bias: This is a collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge.

Racial bias: The tendency to believe that people of a specific racial group have distinctive characteristics and behaviors, generally leading to negative emotional reactions and discrimination.

Serial position bias: The tendency to remember the first and last items in a list better than those in the middle. 

Social desirability bias: The tendency to answer questions in a way that will make you look good to others.

Sunk-cost bias: The tendency to continue a behavior if you've already invested time, effort, and money into it, even if the current costs outweigh the benefits.

Survivorship bias: The tendency to focus on successful cases while overlooking the failed ones.

Transparency bias: The tendency to overestimate how well other people understand your own internal thoughts and feelings, or to overestimate how well you understand other people's thoughts and feelings.

It’s important to be aware of and look for biases in your own UX design. When you’re able to go beyond your own preconceived notions, you will likely be better able to design a product that serves the end-users in a more objective way.

Examples of product failures caused by biases and non-inclusive research
Biases and non-inclusive research can result in product failures. The following are several examples:

Airport body scanners: These are designed to detect masses on individuals' bodies or inside their clothes. However these scanners tend to discriminate, particularly against transgender individuals, Black women, Sikhs, and Muslims. The scanners were not designed with people of color in mind. Individuals with thick hair, or those who wear head coverings tend to endure inconvenient, and oftentimes embarrassing pat-downs.

Real name systems: These kinds of systems require individuals to register an account on a website, blog, or app using their real or legal name. The issue with such systems is that they discriminate against transgender individuals. Requirements of “real names” do not account for individuals who are exploring their identities and do not want assumptions made about their gender and/or preferences. 

Cars and seat belts: Car crash test dummies were modeled after the average man in terms of structure, weight, and height. As a result, the design decisions used to improve human safety during car crashes are largely tailored to men. 

Automatic soap dispensers: Not all automatic soap dispensers sensors can detect individuals with dark skin. The automatic soap dispensers use a light sensor to detect when a hand is beneath the contraption. In many cases, a dark-skinned hand wasn’t light enough to activate the dispenser sensor. 

How to identify and limit bias in UX design
As a UX designer, you can educate yourself about psychological principles that affect your mind, perceptions, and biases. To do this, you can: 

Learn about the different types of bias: Know what biases exist in order to recognize and mitigate them. You can reference some of them in this reading.

Practice self-awareness to identify your own biases: Employ a strategy for developing awareness by practicing reflexivity, introspection, mindfulness, and perspective-taking.

Learn to spot bias in others: Learn to recognize it in your teammates and stakeholders—and don’t be afraid to call it out when it comes up. 

Be responsive: View each design idea as a hypothesis. Be willing to change direction in response to research findings. 

Prioritize impact over output: Conduct a pre-mortem project. This is a loss aversion technique that encourages us to brainstorm potential oversights and identify preventive measures early in our processes.

Key takeaways
Humans have bias, whether learned or unconscious. As UX designers, your job is to do the research, considering all audiences, with an eye towards inclusivity. You’ll also work to identify biases in your design and ideate to remove those design biases. Working with a diverse group of people, and using diverse test groups will help you identify, and remedy, biases in your UX design.
