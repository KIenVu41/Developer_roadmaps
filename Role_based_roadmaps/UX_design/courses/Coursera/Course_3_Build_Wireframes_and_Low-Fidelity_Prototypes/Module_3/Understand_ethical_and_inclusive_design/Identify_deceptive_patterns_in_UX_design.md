This lecture dives into deceptive patterns in UX design, outlining what they are, common types, and why their use is unethical, particularly for UX designers who should prioritize user needs and trust.

Understanding Deceptive Patterns

Deceptive patterns are UX methods that trick users into actions they wouldn't normally take, often employed in e-commerce and marketing content.
These patterns are unethical and erode user trust, potentially harming a company's brand and driving customers away.
Common Deceptive Patterns

Forced continuity automatically charges users for subscriptions without proper warning or reminders after a free trial.
Sneak into basket involves adding extra items to a user's cart during checkout, requiring them to manually remove unwanted products.
Ethical Implications for UX Designers

While deceptive patterns can increase profits, they contradict the core UX principle of empathizing with users and meeting their needs.
UX designers should prioritize ethical design practices that benefit both users and businesses, building trust and positive user experiences.
