Implicit Bias in UX Design

Implicit biases are unconscious beliefs that can influence our decisions and actions, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
In UX design, implicit bias can result in products that exclude or disadvantage certain user groups.
Example of Implicit Bias Impacting UX

Designing a map app for New York City based on the assumption that everyone walks as their primary mode of transportation ignores the needs of individuals who use wheelchairs, rely on public transportation, or prefer other modes of travel.
Combating Implicit Bias in UX Design

Creating detailed user personas and journey maps that consider a diverse range of user characteristics and needs can help mitigate the influence of implicit bias.
Conducting thorough user research is crucial for understanding the diverse needs and experiences of the target audience.
