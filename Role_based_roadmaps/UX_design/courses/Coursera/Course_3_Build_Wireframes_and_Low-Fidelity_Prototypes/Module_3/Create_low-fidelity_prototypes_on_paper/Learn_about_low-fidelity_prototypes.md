Understanding Prototypes

A prototype is an early model of a product used to demonstrate its functionality without building the entire product.
Prototypes allow stakeholders and potential users to interact with the design idea and provide feedback early in the design process.
Low-Fidelity Prototypes

Low-fidelity prototypes are simple, interactive models that provide a basic idea of the final product's look and feel.
They can be on paper or digital and aim to make designs testable for early feedback.
Transitioning from Wireframes

The main difference between a wireframe and a low-fidelity prototype is interactivity, allowing users to navigate between screens.
This interactivity can be achieved through clickable elements in digital prototypes or human interaction simulating screen changes in paper prototypes.
