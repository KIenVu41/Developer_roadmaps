When to Transition to Digital Wireframes:

Ensure your paper wireframe reflects a solid structure for your design, even if it's not a finished product.
Seek and incorporate feedback from peers or your manager to refine your wireframe.
Start considering basic visual cues like different text types, but hold back on colors and images for now.
Key Considerations for Digital Wireframes:

Replace placeholder text with actual content for important elements like section titles and button labels.
Use "Lorem ipsum" as placeholder text for larger chunks of body copy to focus on structure over content.
Refrain from adding expressive content like colors or images at this stage; prioritize functionality and clarity in your digital wireframe.
