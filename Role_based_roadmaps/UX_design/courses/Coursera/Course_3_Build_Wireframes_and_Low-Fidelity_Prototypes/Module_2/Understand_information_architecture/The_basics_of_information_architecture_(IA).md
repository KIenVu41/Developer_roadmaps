What is Information Architecture (IA)?

IA is the practice of organizing and structuring content to ensure users can easily find what they need.
A well-designed IA makes navigation intuitive, helping users understand where they are within a website or app.
How does IA benefit UX design?

IA provides a high-level overview of the product, showing how different elements connect.
It helps stakeholders evaluate the content and its placement for achieving business goals.
