You’ve learned all about wireframing at this point, and you’ve developed your wireframing skills. Now, you will review an example set of paper wireframes a designer built for the CoffeeHouse app. You can use this reading as a guide for creating your own paper wireframes for your portfolio project when you are ready.

As a reminder, a wireframe is a low-fidelity outline of a digital experience, like an app or website. Its purpose is to:

Establish the basic structure of a page

Highlight the intended function of the product

Save time and resources

Wireframes enable designers to:

Identify the content to include in their products

Catch problems early

Get stakeholders to focus on structure

Save time and effort

Iterate quickly

Refer to storyboards and user flow
The designer for the CoffeeHouse app started by reviewing the research, storyboards, and main user flow that a user needs to follow when using the app. 

Because the goal of creating wireframes is to establish the basic structure of a page and to highlight the intended function of each element, designers create multiple wireframes of the same screen. Good UX designers come up with a lot of ideas for the structure of a page—like the homepage—and the intended function of each element they include. Then, they identify the best elements of each drawing and combine them to create a first draft. 

Gather materials
To accomplish this, the designer first gathered the materials needed:

A piece of plain paper (8.5”x11” or larger)

A writing utensil (a pencil works great)

Write a list of the elements to include
Before  drawing, the designer wrote a list of the elements  to include in the wireframe. It’s important to list this information before sketching in order to remember to draw all of the elements in each wireframe. 

In this example, the designer went back to their research and the artifacts/deliverables they’d already built. In particular, the rapid sketching ideation exercise and the storyboards helped this designer prioritize the following features and elements that the potential user will find helpful.

The list of elements for this CoffeeHouse app include: 

Navigation

Search feature

Create the paper wireframes
Create five different versions of how to structure information on the page
After the prep was complete, the designer started drawing. It’s a good practice to create at least five different versions of how to structure information on a homepage, so that’s what the designer for the CoffeeHouse app did. Remember, at this stage, the designer’s goal was to explore lots of ideas with wireframes. Think of this as more focused brainstorming than what was done previously—still producing a wide range of ideas, but now they’re all centered around a single page. 

In the five versions below, the designer:

Created a simple rectangle outline for the phone—for each of the five versions 

Filled in the outlines with the page elements from the list 

Limited time spent on drawings by setting a timer for two minutes for each version, which is about ten minutes total on this single page 

Five quick-sketch versions of paper wireframes

Choose which elements to refine
After coming up with ideas, the designer then needed to decide how to refine, or improve, the wireframe by: 

Reviewing the versions of the wireframe 

Adding a star next to the pieces that were most effective; these starred elements, from the five versions, will make up the final version of the paper wireframe screen

In order to evaluate the effectiveness, the designer took into account these considerations:

The potential user and what they’ll need to do in the product

How to solve the problem statement most effectively

How to pull out the elements that best fit those guidelines

Combine elements into a refined wireframe 
Placing focus on the best of ideas helps narrow down the parts of a wireframe that can be explored further in a digital wireframe. 

For the CoffeeHouse app, the designer combined the starred sections from the five versions into one final design—seen below on the far left side in the red box. The red starred sections to the right indicate where the designer marked which elements to bring into the final design. The designer labeled this combined version as “Home V1.”


Build more refined wireframes to complete the user flow
So far, we have reviewed how a designer built a single wireframe of the CoffeeHouse homepage. The process above would be repeated for additional pages until there were enough wireframes to ensure  a complete and smooth user flow. 

The designer gave some thought to the structure and flow of the entire CoffeeHouse app, and identified the following key screens to create wireframes for:

Menu screen: Users browse through products and make selections. Easy navigation, clear information, and nice visuals encourage exploration and ordering.

Cart screen: The cart displays selected items for purchase, enabling users to review, modify, and proceed to checkout. A smooth and intuitive cart experience helps with successful conversions and a positive user journey.

Checkout screen: The checkout screen provides delivery details, payment options, and purchase completion. A smooth transaction can help reduce the chance of shoppers leaving the cart before items are purchased.

Search screen: An efficient search function helps users quickly find what they seek, improving overall user satisfaction.

When you’re ready to work on your own wireframes, it’s a best practice to create refined wireframes for at least five pages. Make sure you choose the most critical screens to ensure a smooth user flow for your website. For example, creating a “Contact Us” screen might be easy to design and help you hit a minimum number of screens, but be honest with yourself about whether it's critical to your user flow. 

Key takeaways
When you’re ready, you can use this review as a guide to create paper wireframes for your own projects. Remember, you need to have 3–5 completed projects for your portfolio. Keep iterating and improving along the way! 

As you assess your paper wireframes, here are some guiding questions you can use. Did you:

Prepare by gathering materials and creating an elements list informed by storyboards and other created deliverables?

Explore lots of ideas by creating at least five different versions of how to structure information on the page?

Follow industry standards so that each of the wireframes clearly shows the basic structure of the page, including elements like navigation, buttons, images, and text?

Add stars next to the elements of the design that most effectively solve the problem?

Combine all starred elements into a single refined wireframe?

Repeat the process until a user flow is complete?

Red stars in the other five wireframes labeled A through E indicate the most effective elements identified by the designer to combine into the final homepage sketch.
