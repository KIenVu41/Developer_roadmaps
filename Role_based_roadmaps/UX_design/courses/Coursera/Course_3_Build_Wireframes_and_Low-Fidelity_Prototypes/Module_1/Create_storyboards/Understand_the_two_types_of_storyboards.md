This lecture dives into the world of storyboarding in UX design, focusing on two main types: big picture and close-up storyboards.

Big Picture Storyboards

These storyboards illustrate the user's overall journey with a product, highlighting their emotions, pain points, and how the product solves their problems.
Imagine a movie storyboard capturing key scenes and emotions; similarly, these storyboards visually narrate the user's experience and product interaction.

Close-Up Storyboards

Shifting focus from the user's emotions to the product's functionality, close-up storyboards detail specific user actions and screen transitions within the product.
These storyboards are great for refining the product's design, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user flow.

Choosing the Right Storyboard

Big picture storyboards are ideal for early-stage design, communicating the product's value proposition to stakeholders.
Close-up storyboards are beneficial for later stages, focusing on refining the product's usability and user interface.
