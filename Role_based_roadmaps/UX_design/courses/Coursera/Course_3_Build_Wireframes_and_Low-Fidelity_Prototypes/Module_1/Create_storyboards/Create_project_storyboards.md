Introduction
You just learned about user flows, how to create storyboards, and the two different types of storyboards. As a reminder, the four key elements of a storyboard are:

Character

Scene

Plot

Narrative

The character in your storyboard is the user your story is about. The scene helps you imagine this user’s environment. The plot describes the benefit or solution of your design. Finally, the narrative describes the user’s need or problem and how the design will solve the problem.

Now you’ll review how a designer created a big-picture and close-up storyboard for the CoffeeHouse app.

Big-picture storyboard
Like a good movie, a big-picture storyboard can show the emotional engagement that a user will have with an app or product. Understanding how a user feels while experiencing a product is an essential part of the design process.

As a reminder, big-picture storyboards include sketches that:

Focus on the user

Indicate the environment or context where the user is located

Focus on the specific need or pain point experienced by the user

Now, let’s review how the CoffeeHouse app designer approached big-picture storyboarding, starting with the essential elements of a storyboard: the problem statement, goal statement, and scenario statement.

Problem statement

The designer used the same problem statement for both the big-picture storyboard and close-up storyboard:

Anika is a busy marketing intern who needs a faster, more collaborative way to take many coffee orders at once because taking individual orders takes too long.

This problem statement gave the designer a good idea of a character for the story: Anika, a busy marketing intern. It also sets the scene for the storyboards: Anika is entering a large coffee order and picking it up for her office. 

Goal statement

Next, the designer considered the goal statement they had created based on the problem statement:

The CoffeeHouse app will let users place group orders in advance, which will affect users who have to make and pick up large orders by letting users skip the in-store order line and saving them time. We will measure effectiveness by tracking orders of 5+ items placed through the app.

This helps set the plot for the story, which will be about a customer successfully placing a large coffee order quickly and easily.

Scenario statement

The scenario statement describes the narrative that the storyboards depict. This  storyboard tells the story of how the app helps a user submit a large coffee order for pick-up at their local CoffeeHouse shop. The scenario statement is:

An app to help users place large coffee orders quickly and easily.

Based on these elements, the designer created a big-picture storyboard.

Big-picture storyboard showing six panels.Panel 1: Anika wants to get coffee for the team. Anika's surrounded by people giving orders at the coffee shop; Panel 2: Anika remembers that an app can help out in this situation; Panel 3: Anika decides to use the CoffeeHouse app to take orders for her team; Panel 4: Anika learns that they can send the menu of items to the team within the app so the team can place their own orders; Panel 5: Anika sends the order to the coffee shop through the app and the coffee starts brewing; Panel 6: Anika and the team enjoying their coffee in the office.
Notice that the six panels of the template are populated with visuals that demonstrate the user’s experience with the Coffeehouse app. The designer used each visual to highlight a key moment in the user’s journey, including their context and motivations—why they want to use the app—and the high-level experience of successfully using the service. 

Pro tip: Captions are useful for interactions that may be difficult to sketch out.

The storyboard clearly identifies the character, scene, plot, and narrative of your user’s big-picture experience. Together, the six panels tell the story of how the user has used the CoffeeHouse app design to fulfill their goal!

Close-up storyboard
While big-picture storyboards focus on the how and the why, close-up storyboards focus on the what. They seek to answer questions like:

What actions or decisions need to be made on each screen of the product?

What buttons are displayed on each screen of the product?

What does the user do to transition from one screen to another?

What are some assumptions designers are making about this experience?

What are some potentially complicated interactions or pain points that will need to be addressed?

The close-up storyboard is less about the user experiencing your product and more focused on the details of the product itself. The close-up storyboard focuses on the practical aspects of the design, including: 

The product’s user experience

The key interactions, such as onboarding (the first impression a user has of the app)

The actions, such as placing an order and checking out 

Transitions between screens that will provide users with clear actions to perform to complete their goals successfully

Now, let’s review how the CoffeeHouse app designer approached close-up storyboarding. As you know, the problem statement, goal statement, and scenario statement are the same for both the big-picture and close-up storyboards. But, when it comes to the sketches, the two storyboards differ. The close-up storyboard shows sketches of the actions and how the user interacts with the app.

Based on these elements and the purpose of a close-up storyboard, the designer created the following example:

Close-up Opens in a new tab storyboard showing six panels.Panel 1: A hand clicking an icon on the phone home screen. Anika opens up the app; Panel 2: A phone screen; on the screen, it reads "Coffee" at the top, and beneath it is a map with various pins appearing. Anika selects the nearest location; Panel 3: A phone screen; on the screen, it reads "Coffee" at the top, and beneath shows options for link or QR sharing. Anika sends out the menu to the team; Panel 4: A hand interacting with a phone screen, with "Coffee" at the top and a stopwatch beneath it. Anika starts a countdown for the order; Panel 5: Three phones within the frame, all reading "5 mins." The app notifies the team that time is almost up; Panel 6: The phone screen; at the top, it reads "Coffee" and beneath, it reads "Your order" and has a send button at the bottom. Anika sends the order to be made.
Notice that the close-up storyboard sketches are focused on how the user interacts with the app. This is an effective and successful close-up storyboard, as it contains: 

Sketches of what the CoffeeHouse app should accomplish on each panel

Transitions of how the user moves from panel to panel

Instructions on how the CoffeeHouse app should work

Key takeaways
Both big-picture and close-up storyboards were used by the designer when drafting their idea for the CoffeeHouse app. These storyboards focused on the same problem statement, goal statement, and scenario statement. The designer used the big-picture storyboard to visually show important moments in the user’s journey and why the user will want to use the CoffeeHouse app. The designer created a close-up storyboard to focus more on how the user will interact with the CoffeeHouse app and the details of the app itself.
