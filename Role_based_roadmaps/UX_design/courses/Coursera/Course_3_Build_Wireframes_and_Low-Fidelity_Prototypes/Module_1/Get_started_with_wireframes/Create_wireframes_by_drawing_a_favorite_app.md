You’ve learned how to 
draw your first wireframe
 on paper. Wireframes reduce products down to their basic structures and highlight each element’s intended function. They strengthen products—like those you’re working on for your project portfolio—by helping designers ensure:

All necessary elements are included.

No elements are missing or misplaced.

For these same reasons, well-drawn wireframes are excellent to include in your UXD portfolio. When you present your portfolio to prospective employers, wireframes will showcase your ability to carefully plan products that are complete and well organized.

When designers first learn to create paper wireframes, they often practice by working backwards from an existing app. This exercise helps designers understand how to design the structure of a page so they can test out different options.

In this review, you’ll explore an example of a practice wireframe that a designer drew based on the YouTube app home screen. If you choose to create a paper wireframe of an app for your own practice, refer to this example for guidance and comparison.  

The following are the designer’s paper wireframe and an image of the YouTube app home screen. (Note: for the purposes of this review, the app home screen has been scrubbed of any information or images that may be proprietary or identify the app user, which is why the video thumbnails are grayed out and the descriptive text replaced with lorem ipsum placeholder text.)

Screenshot shows YouTube logo and buttons on top, then a pair of video thumbnails and descriptive text, then another series of buttons.
A mobile app to wireframe
Notice that the designer chose an app home screen that has common UI components, such as menus and buttons. These elements make the app a good choice for practicing wireframe- drawing skills. If you choose to do this practice yourself, consider selecting an app screen that features common UI components like those on the YouTube homepage. 

The home screen’s frame
Notice how the designer drew a large rectangle to represent the frame of the app’s home screen. The frame’s dimensions don’t need to exactly match the screen’s dimensions, but they should be approximate so the home screen’s key elements can: 

Fit in within the frame

Be sized and placed similarly to how they appear on the screen

The same rule applies no matter the size, shape, or orientation of the app screen. The dimensions of the screen’s frame and elements don’t need to be precisely exact. But they should approximate the appearance of the actual screen and its elements.

The screen’s key elements
After drawing a frame for the home screen, the designer drew in the screen’s key elements as lines and simple shapes: circles, squares, and rectangles. Importantly, notice how the wireframe follows the industry standards that you learned in earlier course items:

Body text is represented by horizontal lines. Short labels and headings can be written out.

Images, photos, illustrations, and icons are represented by squares with large X’s drawn on top of them. Simple shapes, like menu icons, can be drawn as they appear.

Calls to action—like “submit” or “compose” buttons—are represented by rectangles or circles, whichever fits the basic shape the element has on the screen.

Industry standards help designers ensure their wireframes are simple and understandable, especially for any collaborators. 

Holistic assessment
Before wrapping up, take a moment to review the example holistically. As a whole, does it: 

Fit all of the key elements of the home page in the home screen frame?

Reflect all of the key elements of the app’s home page?

Follow industry standards by representing:

 Body text as horizontal lines?  

 Images, photos, illustrations, and icons as squares with large X’s?  

 Calls to action as rectangles or circles?  

For the wireframe of the YouTube app above, the answer to each question is “yes.” You can use these same questions to assess your own wireframes, whether you’re drawing them for practice, for your portfolio project, or for some other purpose. 

Even if you assess your wireframe as you add each new element, it’s always a good idea to look at the wireframe holistically to ensure all the elements look proportional and organized. Holistic assessment is also crucial for many UX designers on the job, where they have to assess and provide feedback on other designers’ work.

Key takeaways
Converting existing apps to paper wireframes is a great way to practice identifying and drawing the structure and key elements of a page. If you choose to apply these practices to your work, it will help you keep your wireframes simple and understandable. You'll also apply these skills when creating paper wireframes for your portfolio projects in later course activities.
