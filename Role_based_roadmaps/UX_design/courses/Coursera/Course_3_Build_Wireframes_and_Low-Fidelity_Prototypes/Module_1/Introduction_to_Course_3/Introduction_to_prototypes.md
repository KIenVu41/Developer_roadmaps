You are now into the prototyping phase of the design thinking process. In this phase, you’ll build wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes. But before you get too far, let’s learn about some of the activities that UX designers will perform during this phase. Prototyping is an integral part of the design thinking process. It allows for visualization of the product, is a great way to gain feedback on the usability of the product, and can be used as a tool to communicate experiences. The overall strategy for how prototypes are made is dependent on the goal of the project. This reading presents general guidance for best practices going forward. Let’s learn more.

Purpose
A prototype is a tool for visualizing a variety of interactive design work. This visual representation demonstrates:

The actions the product is doing at any given point

The interactive elements

How the product will function when it’s live

The prototype could be a UX design plan for an entire experience or for a singular interaction. 

Benefits
There are many high-value benefits for making a prototype. For UX designers, these benefits include the ability to:

Turn a concept into reality

Work through a problem

Iterate designs based on research and feedback  

Detect unintended scenarios and usability problems

Present more easily to stakeholders 

Test before development and launch

Usage
UX designers use prototyping early in the design process to test ideas. There are a lot of benefits to putting a prototype in front of a user, even if it's a paper prototype. UX designers have to gauge the level of fidelity of the prototype based on what they want to get out of it. It can be a tool to gain feedback from users, explain ideas to stakeholders, or communicate functionality with developers and cross-functional teams before coding begins. It can also be designed as the last phase of product development before the final rollout. Understanding the process of how to create a prototype is an important step in transforming your project from an idea into a product.

Activities
UX designers usually perform the following activities when they are designing a prototype:

Align research and project goals
At this stage in a project, the UX designer has already conducted their initial research. As the UX designer is preparing to start wireframing, they must re-examine their research and align it with the project goals. When a UX designer has a project idea, or is requested for a specific project, the first step is to conduct research on areas such as similar products, different end users, or various device specifications. To do this, the UX designer should ask questions, including: 

What are the goals of the project?

What competitive products are currently used?

Who is the audience, and what are their goals?

What type of product is it, and what (device) is it for?

Are there any visual precedents to follow?

What are the deliverables?

Create low-fidelity wireframes
With the research data available and organized, the next step is to create low-fidelity wireframes. The tools used may vary. UX designers could use paper and pencil or whiteboard and markers. In general, UX designers will follow these steps: 

Create the user flows: This is the step where UX designers can see how the users meet their goals and how they interact within the system. User flows are high-level visual maps that use shapes to represent different interactions. For example, circles usually indicate the actions users take when moving through a product design. Rectangles usually indicate the screens of a digital product that users will experience while completing tasks. Diamonds usually symbolize the decisions users make and either move them forward through the flow or back to an earlier part of the flow. Finally, to connect all of these shapes, lines are used to provide direction throughout the design. You will learn more about user flows in upcoming videos. 

Identify user inputs and outputs: In this step, UX designers will define what the user inputs and outputs are, how they relate to the user behavior and expectations, what interactions they are involved with, and how they work. 

Sketch first wireframes: UX designers can sketch the user flows and get the functionality resolved. By using sketched wireframes, UX designers can connect the information architecture to its visual design by showing paths between pages. They can also use sketched wireframes to help clarify consistent ways of displaying particular types of information on the user interface. 

Create wireframe structures: Here, UX designers can include content, such as text, photos, or video, that will show up as basic boxes or scribbles. It is just for visualization and not for actual use. 

It’s important to note that wireframes and a prototype are not the same. Wireframes are the first step in creating a prototype and are considered quick, affordable, static, and non-interactive design assets that are helpful for team collaboration. 

Create high-fidelity wireframes
After the low-fidelity wireframes are created, the UX designer will work to transition them into high-fidelity wireframes. To do this, the UX designer will digitize their low-fidelity wireframes with a tool, such as Figma. They can convey the look and feel— visualization or fidelity—through visual design, content, and interactivity. 

Create a clickable prototype
UX designers will then add clickable components, making the high-fidelity wireframes into a clickable prototype. A clickable prototype is a digital prototype built with the intention of allowing users to click through it so they can view the interactions and connection points for each page, button, and behavior.

Create a functional prototype
The UX designer will then create a functional prototype. A functional prototype is similar to a clickable prototype except that, instead of supporting clicks and taps, the prototype supports full functionality such as microinteractions and animations (for example, drag and drop). A functional prototype looks and acts as closely as possible to the final product. 

Stakeholders, managers, and even UX designers sometimes forget that prototypes aren’t final. They’re just a draft or an iteration until the next version comes to fruition. It's all part of the design thinking process and an essential skill for any UX designer. 

Key takeaways
Prototyping is an integral part of the design thinking process. It allows UX designers to see firsthand how their designs look and function. It also provides a means for stakeholders and users to test and offer feedback on the designs. This allows UX designers to iterate and improve the designs, which ultimately will lead to a better end-user experience.
