Introduction
You’ve just learned that a user flow is the path taken by a typical user on an app or website to complete a task from start to finish. User flows use common shapes, which make it easier to visualize and communicate the steps, to create a user flow. Let’s do a quick review of what these shapes mean.

User flow shapes: circle is an action; rectangle is a screen; diamond is a decision;  line with arrow ties elements together.
Circles show actions that a user will take when moving through your design. They show a task that must be completed, or steps that must be completed to complete a task from start to finish.

Rectangles describe screens in your digital product, such as a homepage or confirmation page, that users will experience while completing tasks.

Diamonds ask questions where the user must make a decision. The decision made will either move them forward through the flow or back to start the process again.

Lines with arrows tie everything together and display the flow of information.

Now, you’ll review how a designer created a user flow for the CoffeeHouse app.

Identify the user task
 Here’s a reminder of the goal statement the designer created for the CoffeeHouse app: 

Our CoffeeHouse app will let users place group orders in advance, which will affect users who have to make and pick up large orders by letting users skip the in-store order line and saving them time. We will measure effectiveness by tracking orders of 5+ items placed through the app

Goal statement for CoffeeHouse project in template form.“CoffeeHouse app” is the product. “Place group orders in advance” is the perform specific actions. “Users who have to make and pick up large orders” is the describe who the action will affect. “Letting users skip the in-store order line and saving them time” is the describe how the action will positively affect users. “Tracking orders of 5+ items placed through the app” is the describe how you will measure the impact.
With this goal statement in mind, the designer identified a primary user task of users: 

Use the CoffeeHouse app to place a group coffee order quickly and easily.

This is a clear task and provides success criteria for task completion. 

Outline the task steps
Based on the goal statement the designer created, task completion will be reached when users receive their group order confirmation in the CoffeeHouse app. So, to begin, the designer outlined the user flow steps from entry point to task completion in the CoffeeHouse app:

Open app.

View homepage.

Search coffee locations.

Select coffee location.

Order from here? Select “Yes” or “No.”

View order screen.

Click link to share coffee menu.

Send menu to team? Select “Yes” or “No.”

Start order timer.

Team adds items to order.

Order preview.

Go to checkout.

Insert checkout information.

Click checkout.

Next, the designer took this outline and converted it to a user flow diagram, which mapped the task from start to finish. 

The user flow map
First, the designer identified the entry point, which as you just learned, is the place where users initially access the product. Based on the outline they created, the designer knew that the most likely entry point was to open the CoffeeHouse app from a device like a mobile phone. 

User task: Use the CoffeeHouse app to place a group coffee order quickly and easily.

The entry point of a user flow represented by a circle and the words “Open app.”
Then, the designer connected the entry point to the next step in the user flow. In this example, “Open app” is the first action. This action then connects to the user landing page, called “Homepage.”

User flow entry point, represented by circle, “Open app”; connected to landing page, represented by rectangle, “Homepage.”
Once the user determines they want to search for coffee locations and they select a coffee location, it’s time for them to make a decision. The designer accounts for the decision the user might make, represented by the “Order from here?” in the blue diamond. The “Order from here?” is the user’s choice, and the designer used arrows to indicate if the user would continue to the “Order screen” or go back to the “Search coffee locations” screen.

As the designer continued to build their user flow, they used the appropriate shapes that correspond with the action users should complete. 

Here’s the completed user flow the designer created for their CoffeeHouse app.

The user flow shouldn’t be complicated. The objective is to map the quickest and easiest way for the user to get from the entry point to task completion. Notice how this effective user flow example contains:

Clear starting and ending points

Steps that are easy to follow along

Clearly labeled steps represented by the appropriate corresponding shape that indicates a user's actions

Solid and dotted lines with arrow points that connect each step of the user flow

When you’re ready, you can use this example as a guide to build your own user flow diagram.

Key takeaways
A user flow is the path taken by a typical user on an app or website to complete a task from start to finish and should:

Have clearly labeled steps that are each represented by the appropriate shape

Include lines with arrows connecting all the steps of the user flow

The user flow should also be clear and ensure that it’s easy for users to get from the entry point of opening the app to task completion of an order confirmation.
