Interviewing for a job over video conference or phone might seem quite different from an in-person interview, but there are many similarities! You should still come prepared with an elevator pitch about yourself, questions for the interviewer about the role and the company, and your complete portfolio of design work, including your practiced explanation of each case study. 

But there are many reasons that you might not be in the same room as the hiring manager — whether the company is fully remote, you live in a different geographical location than the job, or there are extenuating circumstances requiring a remote interview. If your interview will be remote, there are a few things that you should prepare for. Ready to investigate?

Dress the part: an icon of a interviewee wearing a button down shirt and a suit jacket.
If you interview in person, you might wear a suit or the company’s dress equivalent. When you interview remotely, you may be tempted to dress as you normally do at home. Only the top third of your outfit will be visible on camera, right? 

But wearing an outfit that you’d be happy to wear to an in-person interview is important for a couple of reasons. You never know what might happen during the interview — your front door could blow open or a child could run in the room. You don’t want to stand up and be caught in your pajama bottoms! Additionally, wearing a put-together outfit (including shoes!) from head to toe can make you feel more in control and professional, which is a good mindset for feeling confident, even if you’re otherwise a little nervous.

Test your hardware and software: An icon showing checkmarks on a computer's camera, screen, and headphones.
If you’re asked to log into a video conferencing platform that you’ve never used before, give yourself plenty of time to test it out. Download the tool to your computer, if necessary, and set up a fake call with a friend, or even the recruiter, to test the functionality. 

Whichever video conferencing platform you use, test your computer’s microphone and camera settings beforehand. You want to make sure you know how to find mute, too! Even if you’ve used the tool before, sometimes they disconnect or need to be recalibrated. Consider restarting your computer before the call, so everything runs more easily.

Additionally, test screen-sharing options. If your remote interview involves a whiteboard exercise, you’ll likely have to share your screen or share the file you’re working in, like from Figma or Adobe XD. Make sure you know how to do both types of sharing so you don’t waste time figuring it out during the call.

Prepare your space: an icon that shows the interviewees office space visible to the camera.
While you’re testing the video platform, carefully review the background of your space when you’re on camera. Whether you are in a bedroom, office, or public space, check that whatever is in view represents what you would like the interviewer to know about you. 

Your space and how it’s organized is a strong representation of you. In other words, make sure there are no dirty dishes or piles of laundry in view! Few people are going to expect you to have your interview in a dedicated home office, but make sure you’re presenting your best self. 

If it’s possible in your space, you could share a bit of your personality too, such as arranging the wall behind you with artwork, plants, or something else visually appealing may help you stand out with the interviewers.

Warn your housemates: an icon of someone using a single finger to cover their mouth.
If you are interviewing from home, warn anyone who might be present, like family members or roommates, about your interview. If possible, they should be in another room or outside during your call. Even if they’re quietly reading in the corner, having another person present while you’re interviewing for an important role can make you feel more nervous or self-conscious. Seeing another person on camera during an interview can be distracting for the interviewer too! 

If you lack childcare during the interview’s time period, try to set up an activity that’s as engaging as possible to keep disruptions at bay. And if you have pets, consider giving them a toy or a treat to keep them occupied and quiet. If others in the area are noisy, use the mute button if you need to.  

If you are worried about an interruption, acknowledge that possibility with the interviewer before you begin. Being up front about your situation will help relax you and prepare them in case there is an interruption. 

Bring your notes: an icon that shows a notebook in front of a computer with an interview happening.
Just like for an in-person interview, you should collect quite a few documents before the interview begins, including your resume, questions about the job or process, and the design assets you’ve created. Ideally they should be on paper, so that you can easily show the interviewer without technical difficulties. You don’t want to be switching back and forth between tabs to look at your website or a document during the interview. It can be distracting to both of you!

It’s perfectly fine if you need to look down once in a while to check your notes, but don’t read directly from them. If you think you might be tempted to read your elevator pitch, for example, try taping it to the wall next to your computer screen so you’re still looking up as you read. 

If you’re showcasing design work during an interview, like your portfolio, wireframes, or a prototype, open the platform (like Figma or Adobe XD), your website, and any project materials, including videos, a process book, or a research report in advance of the interview. 


Having a conversation on camera is different than having one in person. Here are a few tips to help you ace the delivery of your interview responses: 

Sit up straight. Poor posture can make you look unprofessional and feel tired. 

Look into the camera. Even though you’re not technically looking into someone’s eyes, when you look in the camera it appears as if you’re making eye contact, especially if there are multiple people on the call. 

Pause before speaking. Give the other person a chance to finish their question or statement. It can be more difficult to understand someone on the other end of the call when two people are speaking.

Like any skill, interviewing remotely gets easier with practice. If you want to be extra prepared, ask a friend or family member to practice an interview with you. Set up a conference call, have a conversation, and complete a design exercise in real time!
