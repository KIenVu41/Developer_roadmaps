The design choices you make as you build your portfolio website communicate your identity as a designer. You want to be thoughtful about these choices and ensure that your portfolio website speaks to your target audience. That audience is potential employers, and they will evaluate whether your skills and style are a good fit for their projects. 

This review will help you think about the types of positions you’d enjoy or organizations you’d like to work for so that you can start refining your portfolio to showcase your skills. 

After completing this review, you can use this as a guide for updating your portfolio to highlight skills relevant to a role you are interested in applying for. 


Step 1: Reflect on your work
A portfolio is the first step of many touch points you'll have throughout the interview process. This is a showcase of your best work and your personal design process, and it’s a chance to share your unique design perspective. You need to include just enough information so that an employer will want to schedule an interview, without including every project you’ve ever done. This makes reflecting and editing a very important step of this process.

The order is important, so put your best work first. The order that you worked on projects doesn't matter. It's important that the portfolio shows the kind of work you enjoy doing, because that's what potential employers will look at when considering you for similar jobs. 

Step 2: Choose a role you are interested in applying for
The job of a UX designer varies depending on the company one works for. In this course, you’ve learned a variety of skills that your UX design job may require. You might lead research efforts on potential users or move forward with the results of a completed research study. You might be creating wireframes from scratch or tasked with adding motion to completed prototypes. Each company and job has different needs. Your portfolio should reflect your ability to complete the required tasks for the job you want.

When developing your portfolio, it’s important to understand the type of UX design job you’d like to pursue. For example, if you’re applying for a position as a UX researcher, you’ll need to demonstrate those skills on your website and search for the type of company that has that type of role. If you don’t have much research experience, you’ll want to build something for your portfolio to demonstrate your ability to do research. Similarly, suppose you plan to apply for a job at a small business where you might need to be a generalist or an all-around UX designer. In that case, you’ll need to show that you understand the process of UX design from the research stage to the final handoff to the engineers. 

Depending on the types of job you are interested in, your portfolio could demonstrate that you will be able to:

Conduct research 

Define a problem in the market 

Understand and evaluate user needs

Empathize with users 

Create the wireframes 

Ideate and build the prototype 

Conduct a usability study 

Convert usability insights into product updates

For each of your projects, be clear about how you led or contributed to the process so a recruiter can understand your involvement and ask you follow-up questions.

Step 3: Start with the basics of your portfolio
Even though you want to tailor your portfolio to the particular type of role you are interested in applying for, there is some information you'll always want to include in your portfolio. We have distilled some common UX elements into a checklist. Some of the items are more concrete than others, but they’re all important for creating a holistic website to demonstrate abilities as a UX designer.

UX designer portfolio checklist
The “must-haves” for a portfolio are listed below:  

A splash/welcome page

Your brand identity

A tone of voice consistent with your personal brand

At least three case studies, such as:

 Your role on the team 

 The product’s goal  

 The research  

 The users  

 Design architecture  

 Wireframes (or sketches)  

 User testing details  

 Mockups  

 Prototypes  

 Final polished designs  

 Results and outcomes  

Lots of images, including mobile and web-based versions of the product, if applicable

No more text than necessary

A dynamic layout

Links to extra information like research or reports, if applicable

Clear navigation

Link to your resume

Your contact information

Step 4: Tailor your portfolio to your audience
Freelancing for project-based work as a generalist designer
If your dream is to be a freelance designer and choose your own projects, your website and portfolio will need to attract clients, demonstrate your knowledge of UX design, and provide contact information.

The audience viewing your website might range from those who do not know UX design to those who are very familiar with it. Because you need to appeal to a broad audience, you’ll want to limit your use of technical jargon or complicated explanations in your case studies. However, every audience can appreciate a compelling story: the user’s journey from defining the problem, to addressing the problem with your designs, to experiencing the product’s ultimate solution. For a role in freelancing or small business, focus your case studies on these elements. 

Whether freelancing or working at a small company, it’s more likely that you’ll run a project from start to finish—you might even be the sole UX designer. Read the job description carefully to make sure both you and the interviewer know exactly what the role entails. 

The example job listing below is similar to the small business and generalist roles defined above. It calls for someone who understands the process of UX design from the research stage to the final hand-off to developers. Take a moment to review the job description.

Freelance UX Designer needed
All41 Inc. seeks a UX Designer to support a current project! This person will help our team envision and design a website as a platform for public engagement. All work will be completed remotely.

Project Overview: The goal of this project is to envision, design, and implement an accountability platform that supports anti-racism across Boise’s arts and culture sector.

This role includes:

Website visual design (i.e., building and iterating actual screen mockups) 

Site maps, UX flows, and wireframes

Project Deliverables:

A research presentation on the landscape of digital tools for public engagement that gives the team ideas and recommendations for how to proceed with design (a competitive audit)

A site map that depicts all pages and content blocks

2–3 rounds of wireframes or interactive prototypes, iterated upon through user feedback sessions for each stage of the site

Final page designs with styles applied and prepared for handoff to developers

An applicant for this position will stand out if they can tell a compelling user story. Check out the following portfolio site, which is nicely tailored for this type of job: 
Shabnam: User Experience Designer

This portfolio has all the elements that would appeal to the organization that posted the job description above. This portfolio addresses each essential point for a well-designed portfolio:

It includes the essential must-haves in the UX designer portfolio checklist.

It demonstrates attributes in the role description, like a previous project working for social good, and specific deliverables that the posted project requires. 

Its structure addresses the hiring audience by acknowledging that the role requires a generalist who can take a project from start to finish.

As you navigate from this designer’s splash page and explore their case studies, their project experience exhibits the understanding of a full UX design process as called for in the job description. The designer also demonstrates experience with projects oriented toward social good—just like the project being advertised! Check out the case study from the portfolio:

Working for large companies and agencies as a specialist 
On the other hand, if you plan to apply for a position at a large company, your audience will likely be hiring managers and recruiters who are familiar with UX design specifics. They’re going to know what to search for in your case studies, including whether you followed accessibility standards and implemented usability study feedback in a way that clearly understands your user. 

When you interview for a job at a larger company, you’ll likely explain your portfolio during the interview. So, you’ll need to make sure your website is easy to present. It’s a good idea to practice moving through your portfolio while talking to see if anything feels clunky, then consider ways to revise the structure to make it flow more naturally.

When applying to work for a larger company, you’re more likely to find yourself on a team with other designers. You might work with researchers and visual designers—it will be essential for you to communicate your ideas to an internal team. In a situation like that, you’ll want to prioritize the specific skills that the job description calls for. 

Step 5: Practice with a friend
After refining your portfolio for a role, it’s time to practice. Ask a friend if you can present your portfolio to them to get their initial feedback. Don’t worry if the friend isn’t familiar with UX—that might be even better! Practice explaining your projects and processes in a clear manner that’s understandable to anyone. While it may be nerve-wracking, doing the first run through with a friend instead of a hiring manager can be beneficial. 



Key takeaways
The way you position your portfolio and the design choices you make on your site will help communicate your identity as a designer and how you'd like to be evaluated as a potential hire. A comprehensive and concise portfolio puts you in the best position to land a great job!

You can use this reading as a guide when you’re ready to finalize your own UX portfolio for a job application. Be sure that your portfolio site:

Includes all essential must-haves from the UX designer portfolio checklist

Expresses a clear understanding of the type of role that interests you

Provides a structure that addresses your hiring audience
