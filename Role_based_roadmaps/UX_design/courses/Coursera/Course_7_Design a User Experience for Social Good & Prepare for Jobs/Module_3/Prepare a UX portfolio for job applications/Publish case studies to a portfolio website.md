You’ve learned so much and practiced so many skills essential to working in the field of UX, and now you’re ready to build on this foundation and grow your career as a UX professional! To help you accomplish this goal, this review will guide you through how a designer published case studies to their portfolio website. This is an important step in having a portfolio website that is ready to share with potential employers when applying for jobs. 

If you would like a refresher on setting up your portfolio website, revisit the readings and videos in Course 2, where you first learned about setting up a website. 

For this example, we’ll be reviewing the portfolio of Joaquin Martinez, a beginner UX designer we’ve been following throughout the certificate. As this portfolio belongs to a fictional character created for this course, links throughout the portfolio (like to LinkedIn and for contact information) are not active. You will be able to use this review as a guide when you are ready to work on your own portfolio. 

Collect case studies
At this point, Joaquin had a case study slide deck for three portfolio projects. The work they put into creating each deck meant that most of the content they needed for their portfolio was already organized. They started by collecting the case studies in one place and gathering any image files they used or wanted to use in their case studies.  

Create website pages and plan layout
At this stage, Joaquin had already started a website and had a general idea of layout and content, so all they needed to do was create a new website page for each case study. Doing this helps to focus the reader’s attention on each project. The designer used their slides as a guide, but didn’t try to exactly replicate the slide decks on the website. Instead, they thought about how best to present their content to capture the interest of employers. 

As introduced in Course 2, there are a number of website builders that allow designers to create professional-looking websites quickly and maintain them without having to code. Here’s a recap of several options: 
Squarespace
,
 Webflow
,
 Wix
, and
 Google Sites
.

These website builders have templates designed for portfolio sites and include basic layouts for portfolio grids, project pages, about pages, and more. Additionally, templates often include font styles for headings and body text, which helps to ensure clear hierarchy of the content and sections. They are great starting points, but keep in mind that you might need to add extra components that aren’t in a  template to make it work for your content. 

Consider the target audience
When designers plan their portfolio website layouts, it’s important that they consider designing for the target audiences and for different platforms. In this case, the audience is recruiters and hiring managers. Since Joaquin had limited time, they focused on ways to make sure their case studies were scannable and easy to understand. Notice in the image below that each case study is represented by an image and is easy to access from the Home page. These features give recruiters and hiring managers a quick visual overview of the work and allow for easy navigation to dive into each case study for more detail.

As Joaquin continued to move the content from the case study deck to a web page layout, they considered how to best balance the visual and text content in a scrolling format. For example, in their original deck, the usability findings were presented with the text explanations on the left and the images on the right. For the web page, Joaquin decided to place the text content above the images so that when the hiring managers scroll down the page, the explanation appears first.

In the example below, notice how the text content above the images explains Joaquin’s thought process on the design change made to the mockups after the usability study. The visual content is presented below as a side-by-side comparison. The captions above each image make the layout more easily scannable. Also, note the use of colored highlight boxes and arrows to help call attention to the specific change in the mockups.

Pro tip: Whether you arrange text and images side by side, above and below, or another way, try to keep the arrangement consistent throughout the case studies.

Optimize text for the portfolio website
Since the audience probably won’t read every word of the case study, the designer applied some of these tips and tricks for easy scannability:

Use visual hierarchy to guide the audience through the case study.

Constrain the width of text sections for easier reading.

You can see how the designer used different font sizes to help with visual hierarchy and how some content from the slide decks was consolidated or moved to more effectively tell a concise story.

Optimize visuals for the portfolio website
The visuals in each case study are key to making a strong impression in a short amount of time. For the most part, you should be able to repurpose the visuals you used in your slide decks for your website. 

In this example, when Joaquin, the designer, transferred their images over, they made sure the resolution quality was still high, especially for those images that were presented at a larger size on the website. They also decided where the images should be in relation to the text.

An important consideration for your portfolio website that might differ from your slide deck is the presentation of your final design mockups. Take some extra time to style your mockups to look impressive and eye-catching. How your mockups look could be the deciding factor on whether a recruiter or manager takes the time to review your case study in greater depth.  

Showing your design mocks within device frames (such as phones or desktop screens) helps present your work in a clean and professional way and provides context for how the designs would appear to a user. There are many device mockup templates available to download that you can use to showcase your designs. 

In this example below, focus is placed on final designs through the use of device frames and background color.

Get feedback
When you’re ready to publish your case studies to your website, it’s time to start sharing them. It’s always a good idea to seek out some feedback from others about your case studies, especially when the feedback comes from peers or mentors in the UX design field. Ask them:

Did the case studies represent who I am as a designer?

Were you able to quickly and efficiently skim the information? 

Do they tell and show an engaging story? 

Key takeaways
Remember that your portfolio should represent you and your work as a UX designer, so as you continue to grow in your career, make sure to keep your portfolio updated with strong case studies. When you’re ready to publish case studies to your portfolio, consider comparing the examples we’ve provided to your own work. As you assess your work, here are some guiding questions you can use. Did you:

Create a new website page for each case study?

Consider designing for the needs of the target audiences and for different platforms?

Use different font sizes to help with visual hierarchy?

Consolidate or move content from the slide decks to more effectively tell a concise story?

Take some extra time to style your mockups to look impressive and eye-catching—for example, by showing your design mocks within device frames?
