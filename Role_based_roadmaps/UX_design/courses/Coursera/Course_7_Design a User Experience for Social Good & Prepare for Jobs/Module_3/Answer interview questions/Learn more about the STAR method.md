In the video, you just learned about using the STAR method to answer interview questions clearly and directly. Using the STAR method can make your responses easy to follow and provide a logical structure to each story you share.

STAR spelled out in four individual graphics: Situation, Task, Action, Result
As a reminder, here’s what each letter of the STAR acronym stands for: 

S is for situation. Describe the context around a particular circumstance, challenge, or event you experienced.

T is for task. Describe your responsibility in this situation. What were you asked to do, or what problem were you asked to solve?

A is for action. Describe what you did to meet the challenge or solve the problem. Give specific details that demonstrate your abilities in the job.

R is for result. Describe the outcome of the project or task. Give specific numbers whenever possible to make your results more concrete.

What does the STAR method look like in action? Well, we asked three UX designers at Google to use the STAR method to answer these common UX design interview questions:

Can you tell me about a time when you did your own research?

What part of the design process do you enjoy doing the most? Why?

How have you handled receiving negative feedback about your designs?

Interview question: Can you tell me about a time when you did your own research?

S and T from Kartik's STARS
Situation:
When I was a UX intern at Google, I was designing new user flows for a wearable device. [A wearable device is technology that users wear and interact with, like a smartwatch.]

T
Task:
I wanted to find out if there were any issues in these new user flows. I had tested 
these flows multiple times myself, but I was biased since I was the designer. 
The new designs had to be delivered within two days for engineering implementation, so I was too short on time to ask a UX researcher to help fully test the new designs.
A and R from Kartik's STAR.A
Action
I decided to use a heuristic evaluation method to test these new flows. 
I gathered my team (four engineers, two managers, and two designers) in a meeting room. Heuristic evaluation involves examining an interface and seeing 
if it complies with a set of usability principles. Each of my team members put on the wearable device one at a time, and I gave them tasks to complete using the new flow. They were also given a set of usability principles (heuristics). While they performed the task, they had to evaluate the design and find usability problems in the interface with reference to the heuristics. 

R
Result
Each team member performing the tasks found a few common and unique 
usability problems. In a meeting of an hour, the team of eight people found 13 usability problems in the new designs! I documented these problems and fixed them before delivering the new designs for the engineering implementation. 
So, doing my own research for this project paid off.

Interview question: What part of the design process do you enjoy doing the most? Why?

S and T from Alice's STARS
Situation:
I love the iteration process! After the design process (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test) is completed and the initial designs have been tested, like in a usability study, the designer receives feedback from the engineering team, research studies, and cross-functional partners. Then, we iterate! 


T
Task:
The iteration process balances understanding engineering constraints and business strategies with user and market needs.
A and R from Alice's STARA
Action:
I personally like how designer empathy takes a back seat for once, and the problem solving muscle is exercised to the maximum. To be a great partner, the designer needs to demonstrate understanding and provide solutions to all stakeholders' needs. 

R
Result:
This process typically would go through a few rounds of reiterations, with communication, collaboration, and presentations on repeat. For a project I recently worked on, we conducted multiple rounds of user testing and iterated on the designs after each round. Even after the product launched in the real world, we are still iterating! During these reiterations, I feel like an empowered captain to a giant moving ship. That’s why iterating is my favorite part of the design process!
Dane
Visual designer at Reach UX, Google

Interview question: How have you handled receiving negative feedback about your designs? 

S and T from Dane's STARS
Situation:
After presenting user testing feedback for a mobile application I was working on in Hong Kong, I received feedback that the insights from initial interviews and testing were based too heavily on U.S. culture.

T
Task:
Being that this was a mobile app based in Hong Kong, I needed to understand the behavioral differences that come from interacting with digital touchpoints on the opposite side of the world.
A and R for Dane's STARA
Action
My goal was to research interaction patterns and interview people who knew first-hand the major differences when it came to building out the solution. 
I found myself reworking elements on the screen, such as text spacing for buttons, and designing for all devices, not just an iPhone. I also restructured 
my persona's favorite trends and hobbies to be HK specific products and locations. This prompted the idea to explore designing for right-to-left languages.

R
Result 
Not only was I able to expand my horizon and truly understand the fact that I'm not the user, I was able to develop a new app based on culturally specific patterns and insights.
