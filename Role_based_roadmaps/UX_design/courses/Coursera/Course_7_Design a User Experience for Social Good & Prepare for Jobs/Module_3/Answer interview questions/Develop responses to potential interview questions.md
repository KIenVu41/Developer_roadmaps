You’ve learned that anticipating interview questions and planning answers is a great way to prepare for an interview. You’ve also explored the STAR method for preparing and delivering answers. Now you’ll review tips for anticipating interview questions and explore a completed example of an interview response that applies that method. 


Make a list of interview questions
Before you review the STAR example, consider taking a moment to brainstorm a list of interview questions that you may be asked during a job interview for a UX design role. You don’t have to make a list now, but when you’re ready, here are some tips: 

Reflect on any past job interviews you’ve done, especially any for UX design jobs, and consider some of the questions you were asked then.

Identify people you know who have been through the UX design interview process, and ask them what questions they encountered.

Revisit the items from earlier in this course, such as the

, and include some of the questions you explored there.

If you want to, consider using the STAR method to create answers to some of your questions. Then, you can compare your work to the example.

Explore an example STAR response
Now, it’s time to explore an example of an interview answer that was developed with the STAR method. Remember that the STAR method is a way to create clear, concise, and compelling answers that showcase  important aspects of your experiences. STAR stands for situation, task, action, and result. 


Consider the following example. An entry-level designer has recently completed Google’s UX Certification program. As they apply for jobs and prepare for interviews, they anticipate the following question:

Can you tell me about a time when you did your own research to understand user needs?

Using the STAR method, the applicant writes out the following response:

Recently, I completed a UX certification program [Situation] in which we were tasked with designing an app and website to help individuals limit their food waste. The mock organization knew that people wanted to limit waste but didn’t know how to help. [Task] I reached out to interview participants in two categories: people who were already working to mitigate food waste and people who wanted to but didn’t know how to start. Through in-depth interviews, I discovered that the base issue revolved around understanding how long food (both cooked leftovers and fresh ingredients) lasted once it was in participants’ fridges. [Action] That led me to develop a product that helped keep an accurate inventory of food that was easy to update and reminded users when it was time to eat something and how they could use it. [Result]

Consider how this answer applies the STAR method. The applicant:

Begins by stating a specific situation they’ve experienced that relates to the question you’re answering. In this case, it’s their experience in the UX certification program.

Relates that situation to a task they were required to complete: designing an app and website to help people limit food waste.

Explains the specific actions they took to complete that task, such as recruiting interview participants, conducting interviews, and so on.

Shares the results they achieved because of these action: developing a product that helps people keep food inventories. 

By focusing on the STAR method’s four aspects, this answer clearly and efficiently addresses the question asked! It is structured in a way that’s relevant and easy to follow.

Pro tip: When you prepare interview answers, remember to conclude some of your answers by giving interviewers a sense of who you are and why you’re applying. For instance, you might wrap up an answer by saying: "That's what I love to do the most: Make the complex easy to understand” or "That's the type of challenge I'm searching for to grow in my career." Be well prepared with specific points about how your unique background and experiences fit the position.

Key takeaways 
The interview process can seem intimidating and overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. Drawing up a list of interview questions and answers ahead of time is a great way to prepare for an interview. The STAR method isn’t just a great way to prepare interview answers. It’s also a pattern you can learn and deploy as needed. Just remember: What was my situation? What was my task? What actions did I take? What results did I achieve? The more you plan and practice answers with this method, the better able you’ll be to use it when giving unplanned answers to unexpected questions!
