During job interviews in the UX design field, prospective employers will typically ask you to present your design portfolio. For employers, after all, portfolios are powerful evidence of your qualifications for the role and your ability to add value to the organization. 

When asked to present your portfolio, there are many approaches you can take. Your interviewer might have a set structure for you to follow, or it might be up to you to drive the process. To help you prepare for either scenario, this reading explains guidelines for creating an effective interview presentation. We’ve also provided a portfolio presentation template to help you get started and ensure that you include the key elements in your presentation. 

You don’t have to create a presentation now, but this reading will be a helpful resource whenever you’re ready.


Common presentation elements
Portfolio presentations typically include these key elements: 

Introduction: Introduce yourself and your background.

Assigned exercises: Present any design exercises that your prospective employer assigned to you.

Primary case study: Present a case study of your most important or relevant design work.

Secondary case study: If time allows, present an additional case study.

Discussion: Invite questions and have a conversation with your interviewers!

The template below provides a good structure for you to include these elements in your presentation.

The following are guidelines for each element of a typical portfolio presentation. 

Pro tip: While these guidelines represent common practices of UX designers, they are not a rigid formula you must follow exactly. You may need to adapt them to suit your own needs, style, or portfolio. You may also need to adapt them to meet any specific requirements or expectations set by the people interviewing you.

Introduce yourself and your background
The first three slides in the interview presentation template will help you break the ice!

Slide 1: Introduce yourself by name on your first slide and include a title/role to describe what you do.

Slide 2: Include a table of contents so that your interviewers know what’s ahead in your presentation. (The table of contents slide also gives you a chance to take a breath and remember what you want to say and how you want to say it!) 

Slide 3: Describe your background as a designer and the products you’ve created. 

The following series of slides will help you talk about your previous experience and expertise.

Present any pre-assigned design exercises
Slide 4–X: Present pre-assigned design exercises (optional) The number of slides you use will depend on what the interviewer wants to see. It could be one slide, or it could be five slides. 

Your interviewers may give you a pre-assigned design exercise you'll need to present. If your interviewers assigned a design exercise, that should be the first thing you present in the interview. You’ll have information about the assignment details and what you should present well ahead of time. 

If the interviewers don't give you a set presentation structure to follow, you can use the slides from our interview presentation template to present your design process for the assigned exercise. 

Case studies
Typically, you should prepare to present at least two case studies. First, you'll want to present the most important or relevant piece of design work from your portfolio. Let this be Project 1 in your presentation template. 

Next, if you have time or your interviewers ask, present an additional case study that showcases how your design approach matches the job you’re interviewing for. 

If you need to present more than two projects, copy case study slides one through five (below) and paste them into your presentation for a third set of case study slides. The number of case studies that you’re expected to present will vary from interview to interview. It will also vary depending on the size and scope of the case studies you’re presenting. 

A general rule is to present two of your own more significant projects or to present a design exercise and one significant project. If you’re unsure what to present, make sure to ask! Or better yet, suggest two or three options and invite your prospective employer to select the option(s) they like best.

Present your most important or relevant portfolio case study first
Case study slides one through five in the interview presentation template are designed to help you present the project in your portfolio that you feel is most important or relevant to the role you are interviewing for. There are key points you should focus on when you present any case study. You want to:

Case study slide 1: Clearly state the user you designed for and describe the user’s goals and pain points. You should also explain how you used the design process to help solve the user problem. UX designers should always put the user front and center, so you want to showcase this in your work. 

Case study slide 2: Explain your design process in order and draw attention to the deliverables you created. As part of this, you’ll want to describe how your designs were tested at each stage and explain the improvements you made to your designs based on your testing. 

Case study slide 3: Include views of your final product. Be sure to include mockups as well as descriptions to explain your product. Include a link to a high-fidelity prototype if you have one available for the product. 

Case study slide 4: Show evidence of your design’s impact on the problem you intended to solve and any next steps your design inspired. Include data that supports your claims. 

Case study slide 5: Share lessons you learned from your work on this project. What new insights might you take into your next project? 

Present an additional case study from your portfolio
If you have time, present an additional case study that showcases how your design approach matches the job you’re interviewing for. Repeat the presentation process you used for your first project:

Case study slide 6: State the user you designed for, their problem, and how your design process solved that problem. 

Case study slide 7: Explain your design process.

Case study slide 8: Display the final product. 

Case study slide 9: Explain the impact of your design. 

Case study slide 10: Describe the lessons you learned from creating your product. 

Present key takeaways
Consider how you are evolving as a designer. Recruiters and hiring managers are searching for someone who wants to learn and grow. The key takeaways slide in the template offers you a space to show your growth by calling out things you’ll do differently in future designs.  

Don’t be afraid to show how you’ve learned from mistakes and made your failures productive. Productive failure is key to awesome design.

Take questions
Use the questions slide to invite questions from your interview panel about the information you presented.

Keep in mind that the interviewer's job is to ask questions to learn more about your thought processes. So don’t be surprised if they have a lot of questions for you! If your portfolio site includes an FAQ page, you might present the link to it on this slide. 

Thank your interviewers for their time
On your final slide, you should thank your interviewers for their time and consideration.

Practice giving your presentation
Once you’ve created your interview presentation, practice giving your presentation:

Start by presenting in the mirror. 

Ask your family and friends to watch you practice and provide constructive feedback. 

Record yourself giving your presentation, and note the things you did well and the areas where you need improvement. 

Finally, when you’re ready to present your portfolio, remember to keep calm and confident. You’ve done amazing work, and showing confidence in your design choices will make you appear more professional.

Save your work
If you create a portfolio presentation, remember to save all of your work to your computer, a hard drive, or a Google Drive folder to make sure you have all the resources you'll need later in the course for your portfolio.

Key takeaways
Portfolio presentations are a key way that UXD job applicants showcase their skills, experience, and value for prospective employers. There’s no one right way to create or structure a presentation, but the guidelines in this reading reflect common practices used by experienced UX designers. Whatever approach you take, make sure to follow any instructions or requests from your interviewers; prepare the presentation with care; and then practice, practice, practice. Your design work deserves the best possible showcase, and so do you!
