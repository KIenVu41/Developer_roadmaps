You might expect to be asked a lot of questions about yourself and your work during an interview. However, you shouldn't think of an interview as a one-way conversation; it’s important for you to ask your interviewer questions as well. Asking questions in return shows that you're genuinely interested in what the position requires and what the interviewer has to say. Additionally, it helps you determine if the company you're interviewing for is a right fit. In this reading, you’ll learn how to ask questions during an interview and read some examples of questions to ask.

Although it’s important to ask questions during the interview, you want your questions to be “good” questions that help improve your understanding of the position and the company. You wouldn’t want to waste anyone’s time by asking questions that could be easily answered by a quick internet search. 

To avoid asking obvious questions, do some research ahead of your interview. Visit the company’s website and read news articles or press releases about the organization. That way, your questions will be more meaningful and provide clarity on things that piqued your curiosity during your internet search

Questions to ask: an icon of an interviewee and an interviewer talking.
It’s crucial to put thought into the questions you plan to ask during an interview. Asking carefully thought out questions makes you appear engaged and interested in the job. Some options include questions about the position, the organization, professional development opportunities, the interviewer, and clarifying questions. 

The position
Start by asking specific questions about the job that will help you determine if you are the right fit for the position. Some common questions include:

What would my day-to-day responsibilities involve?

What are the skills and experiences you’re looking for in an ideal candidate?

What would my typical day look like?

What are some recurring issues or problems that the team is looking to solve?

The organization
Questions about the organization can help you develop the full picture of the company’s culture. These questions will help you understand the company’s values and determine if they align with your own. They can also help you explore where the company is growing. For example, you could ask:

What are the current goals that the company is focused on? 

What areas of the company would you like to see growth?

What’s the company culture like?

What can you tell me about your new products or plans for growth?

Professional development opportunities
Employers recognize that employees entering entry-level positions want to grow in their field. However, they may not be forthcoming with information about professional development opportunities since their primary focus is filling the current vacancy. It’s okay to ask questions related to professional growth since you are not expected to stay in an entry-level position forever. These questions may include:

What are ways that a person in this position may advance within the organization?

Do you offer any mentorship opportunities?

What kind of guidance is available for employees working towards career goals? 

The interviewer
Flipping the script on the interviewer and asking them questions about their thoughts is a great way to get more information about your role. It also shows the interviewer that you value their opinion. Don’t hesitate to ask questions like:

What is the most rewarding thing about your job?

What do you love most about the company?

What do you think every incoming employee should know about working at the company?

Clarifying questions
Finally, it’s important to seek clarification on the next steps of your potential employment. Asking these questions is important because they help determine a clear timeline for if you are offered the position. They also help determine if any subject might have been left out of the interview. These questions might include: 

Is there anything else I can provide you with that would be helpful?

What are the next steps in the interview process?

Is there anything else I could answer that would give you more insight to who I am?

Now that you’re familiar with good questions to ask, what questions shouldn’t you ask? Inappropriate or irrelevant questions could negatively affect how your employer sees you. 

Turnover
Questions about employees who are no longer at the company can make your interviewer uncomfortable. The role you are interviewing for may have been left vacant by a disgruntled employee. Or, maybe the former employee was terminated. To avoid putting your interviewer in an awkward position, don’t ask questions like:

What happened to the last employee in this position?

What are some reasons your employees leave the company?

Why was the last employee in this role let go?

Workplace flexibility or time off
Asking too many detailed questions about on-the-job perks during your interview can make you seem unfocused. Benefit details are typically covered in a job description or by the Human Resources department during a job offer, so during the interview you should avoid questions like:

How many vacation days do we get a year?

Is it okay to take long breaks?

What’s the latest I can arrive to work?

Abilities, religion, or political views 
There are many questions connected to beliefs and identity that interviewers are legally not allowed to answer, so it’s not advised to bring up these topics. It can also be perceived as unprofessional to bring up sensitive topics. If you have concerns about these topics or are curious about the cultural norms of a company, reach out to your recruiter to learn where you should direct these questions. Otherwise, don’t ask questions like:

What political party are you associated with?

What percentage of employees here are religious? 

What are your thoughts on the last election?

Proprietary information
While you may be excited to interview with a company that you admire, you shouldn’t ask about information that hasn’t been made available to the public. Pushing your interviewer to give up information on private information could come off negatively. Don’t ask the following:

Are there any secret products being worked on now?

Although it hasn’t been shared publicly, can you tell me the launch date of your next product?

When to ask questions: an icon showing a clock above an interviewer and interviewee.
When you want to pose a question to your interviewer, timing is important. Asking questions in the middle of your interview could hinder the process and prevent your interviewer from learning more about you. You also don’t want to interrupt your interview as they are speaking. 

Save questions that require lengthy answers for the end. Usually, interviewers ask if you have any questions for them. This is the perfect time to inquire about anything not covered earlier in the interview. 

Resources for interviewing more effectively
Employers expect questions, so don't be afraid to ask. Asking these questions will only deepen your understanding of your next role and the company you will be working for. For more information about the types of questions you should ask during your interview, check out these resources.
