Whiteboard Interviews

These interviews simulate real-world design scenarios, allowing interviewers to assess your problem-solving approach, design thinking, and communication skills in action.
To prepare, research common whiteboard interview questions, practice articulating your thought process out loud, and don't hesitate to ask clarifying questions during the interview.
Take-Home Design Exercises

These exercises assess your ability to apply your design skills independently.
You'll be given a design prompt and a set amount of time to develop a solution, which you'll then present and discuss.
Remember, interview preparation is key! By understanding the purpose and format of these exercises and practicing your design skills, you'll be well-equipped to showcase your abilities and impress potential employers.
