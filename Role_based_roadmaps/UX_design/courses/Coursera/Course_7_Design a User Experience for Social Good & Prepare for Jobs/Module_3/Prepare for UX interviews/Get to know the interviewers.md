Understanding Interviewer Roles

Recruiters are the bridge between you and the hiring manager. They conduct initial screenings, often via phone, to assess your fit for the role. They also provide support and information throughout the process.
Hiring managers are directly involved in your day-to-day work if you get the job. They ask more in-depth questions about your experience, skills, and how you handle situations.
Researching Your Interviewers
