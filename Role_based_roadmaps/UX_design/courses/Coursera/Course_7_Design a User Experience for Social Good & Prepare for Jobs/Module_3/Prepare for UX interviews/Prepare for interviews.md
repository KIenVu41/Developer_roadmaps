Great news! You’ve submitted your application and received an email asking for an interview. But the work isn’t over yet; you still have a lot of preparation to do to make sure you’re ready for all those interviews. This is the stage that a lot of people start to get nervous, but there’s no reason to be. The best way to combat nervousness is to prepare, and that’s what you’re going to learn to do here!

Phone Interview. An icon of a interview taking place on a computer
First things first: You need to showcase your best self in that introductory phone call with the recruiter or hiring manager. This conversation probably won’t go into too much depth about your design process, but you will talk a lot about yourself and your work: who you are, what kind of work or training you have, why you want the job, your projects, and your portfolio. You might also be asked specifically about your salary requirements. 

Since you know that you’ll be asked to talk about yourself and why you’d make a great UX designer, these are things you’ll want to prep ahead of time. Write down your answers in full. Practice delivering them. Remember, you want to talk to the recruiter like a human, not a robot: try to relax, smile, and share your enthusiasm, so you can be clear about your professional experience and interest in the job. Although you may not work directly with the person you’re speaking to on the phone, they’re likely going to make a judgement about whether you’d be a good fit in their office. In other words, are you pleasant to be around?

Do your research
Make sure you’ve done your research on the company. When the interviewer asks why you’d be a good fit for the job, they want to hear why you’re a talented UX designer and also why you want to work at that company specifically. 

There are plenty of other common questions that interviewers will ask at this stage. These articles provide a good place to start:

Prepare for the second round
Your second-round interview will be more focused on what you can offer as a designer. You’ll likely discuss yourself here, too, but you’ll also be going into more depth about your experiences as a designer. You’ll want to review the same material you prepared for your screening call, but you’ll also need to fully review your portfolio as well. Consider how you’ll talk about your work with the hiring manager, and be prepared to explain why you made particular choices and what you learned from the design process.

Depending on where you and your interviewer are located, the second-round interview might be over the phone or video conference. But when possible, the interview is likely to be in person at this stage. In-person interviews often last an hour or so, but if you traveled for your interview or the company likes to bring candidates in for all the remaining interview stages at once, you might complete your panel interview with a group that day as well.

During the panel interview, you’ll be talking to two or more people about yourself and your potential, so it can get a bit more nerve-racking. Thinking positively helps deal with any nervousness. Remind yourself: The team brought you in for the interview for a reason. They think you might be a great fit! Plus they’re impressed with your work. When you start from a place of confidence, you’re more likely to project expertise about the UX design industry and demonstrate your ability to work well with the team. 

If you’re still feeling nervous, now is a good time to practice the techniques you learned for presenting your designs for user feedback earlier in the program. Remember power poses, like the Wonder Woman pose? If you need a refresher on this and other techniques to squash stage fright, review the resources from a previous course.

The final step of the second round of interviews is the whiteboard interview. This is where you’ll create a design in real time. You might work alone or you might work with someone on the interview team to create a product based on a prompt they provide. It’s a big deal, but this is what you’ve prepared for. All those Sharpen design prompts are built to mimic the types of design challenges you’ll be asked to solve during your whiteboard interview. So you know what to do. Follow the steps of the design process you’ve been through in this program already: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Of course, you’ll be time-restricted in an interview setting, but the interviewer will give you more guidance on what exactly they’d like to see from you during the interview. It’s perfectly fine to ask questions at this point if you’re unclear about any guidelines.

There are plenty of ways to practice for the whiteboard interview as well.
