In this lesson, you’ve learned what AI is and how it might help you as a UX designer. Then, you practiced prompting a generative AI (gen AI) tool to produce useful outputs. It’s helpful to use the T-C-R-E-I (task, context, references, evaluate, and iterate) framework to guide your prompts. When you Thoughtfully Create Really Excellent Inputs, you’re more likely to get results that work for you!

Keep experimenting with gen AI tools to brainstorm ideas, boost your productivity, help you avoid mistakes, and aid in your decision-making process. Practice with Gemini or other gen AI tools to find out more about these topics as you apply what you’ve learned in your Google UX Design Certificate to your work—or explore using it outside of work to continue your AI learning journey.

Key takeaways
The growing role of AI in UX design
AI is rapidly changing the world of UX design. As a UX designer, you can boost your career by understanding this powerful technology and how to use it effectively in your daily work. While you continue to develop expertise in this profession, remember that:

Understanding and using AI is important for your future success as a UX designer, as AI tools become more commonly used in the field.

AI tools can help you perform tasks such as analyzing data, building personas, and improving accessibility.  

How UX designers can use gen AI to work smarter and faster
Gen AI is a type of AI that’s capable of creating new content. You can use gen AI tools to complete both practical and creative tasks. As a UX designer, you might use gen AI tools to:

Create content, like copy for labels, buttons, and other design elements.

Analyze and summarize large amounts of information, like user feedback.

Answer questions about best practices for improving accessibility across your designs.

Draft wireframe layout variations and recommend updates on designs.

Basic guidelines for responsible use of generative AI
AI tools have their share of limitations. To use generative AI responsibly, make sure to: 

Review generative AI outputs carefully for accuracy and usefulness.

Disclose your use of generative AI.

Consider the privacy and security implications of using generative AI, and avoid entering sensitive information.

Apply a human-in-the-loop approach, as AI should always serve as a complement to our human skills and abilities.

Note: This list is not exhaustive. Be sure to check your company’s policies on the use of generative AI.

AI in action: real-world applications in UX design
In this lesson, you learned how a real UX professional harnesses AI technology in their role at Google. Paolo shared how gen AI tools like Gemini can help you:

Create personas to better understand the needs and expectations of target users.

Iterate on design ideas to quickly explore options and kickstart the brainstorming process.

Communicate design concepts to stakeholders in easy-to-understand ways.

Build your knowledge by making sense of complex design frameworks.

Develop engaging copy for your portfolio website to stand out to potential employers or clients.

Try these examples out yourself using Gemini or another gen AI tool, and keep experimenting to uncover new ways to apply AI to your role and responsibilities. With help from AI, you can spend less time on repetitive, routine tasks and devote more of your energy and attention to designing incredible experiences.
