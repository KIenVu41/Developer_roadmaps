Boosting Creativity with AI

When creative blocks arise, Generative AI tools can provide a fresh perspective and help explore a wider range of design possibilities.
These tools act like a team of diverse thinkers, offering suggestions and uncovering potential issues that might have been overlooked.
Using Generative AI for Design

Providing context to the AI tool is crucial. In this case, inputting existing design ideas helps the AI build upon them rather than suggesting the same ideas.
The AI can then offer feedback and suggestions, such as focusing on user journey visualization, content audits, accessibility testing, and mobile optimization.
