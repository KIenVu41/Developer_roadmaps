Finding Clients

Leverage your professional and personal networks, potentially offering a finder's fee for successful referrals.
Consider offering pro bono services to gain experience, build your portfolio, and potentially break into new markets.
Managing Client Relationships

Clearly define the scope of work upfront with clients, especially for pro bono projects, to avoid scope creep.
Don't hesitate to renegotiate the scope of work and discuss rates if additional work is requested beyond the initial agreement.
