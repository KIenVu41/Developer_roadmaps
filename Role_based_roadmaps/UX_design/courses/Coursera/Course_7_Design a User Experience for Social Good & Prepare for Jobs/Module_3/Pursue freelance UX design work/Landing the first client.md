Securing the Project

It starts with receiving a Request for Proposal (RFP) which outlines the project scope, followed by you submitting a compelling proposal.
Once selected, you'll receive a Statement of Work (SOW), a legally binding document detailing deliverables, timelines, and payment terms.
Understanding Key Documents

The SOW should clearly define payment schedules, often including upfront payments (40-50% is common) to secure your services.
For creating legally sound contracts, resources like NOLO, Legal Zoom, and Web Design Law offer templates and guidance.
The Value of First Clients

Landing your first client is a significant milestone, often leading to valuable word-of-mouth referrals and potential repeat business.
Their positive experience can significantly contribute to building your reputation and expanding your client base.
