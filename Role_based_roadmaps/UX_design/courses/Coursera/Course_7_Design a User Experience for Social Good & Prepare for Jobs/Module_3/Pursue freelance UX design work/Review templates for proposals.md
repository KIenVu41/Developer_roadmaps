When you work as a freelance UX designer, potential clients who are impressed by your designs might send you a request for proposal, an official document that outlines project requirements. Or, they may submit an informal request to establish a working relationship with you. Gaining new clients is an exciting chance to practice your design skills. But, before diving into the creating a product, you should respond by sending a proposal. 

A proposal outlines your approach to successfully delivering the work a client has requested. These documents are important for establishing an effective working relationship between you and your client. Your proposal also helps to instill confidence in your ability to do the work on time and on budget, while meeting the project objectives. In this reading, you’ll learn about the various materials you might encounter as a freelance UX designer. 

Sections of a proposal

Payment schedule with an icon that has a calendar and money
While proposals may be worded differently, there are four sections that are necessary: a statement of work, project timeline, budget estimate, and payment schedule. Here’s what each of those provides to a client.

Statement of Work: A legally binding document that includes a list of detailed deliverables, their due dates, and a payment schedule

Project Timeline: A list of dates for expected milestones in the development of the project 

Budget estimate: Details the expenses and profit margins that add up to an appropriate cost for your services 

Payment schedule: A list of expected payment dates and any upfront costs and contingencies

Proposals may also include an introduction to you as a designer, your design process divided into phases, and specific payment terms. 

Start with templates
