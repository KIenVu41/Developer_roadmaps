A Concise and Articulate Portfolio

Just like good design, your portfolio's writing should be clear, concise, and easy to read. Recruiters often review numerous portfolios, so make sure yours is engaging and highlights the most important information about your work.
Think of the "above the fold" concept from newspapers. Your introduction, including your name and what you do, should be immediately visible on your homepage without scrolling.
Writing an Effective "About Me" Page

Your "About Me" page allows you to elaborate on your skills, experience, and passions.
Use this space to provide details about your work style, values, credentials, notable projects, and contact information.
Tips for Writing Portfolio Content

Use clear and concise language, avoiding jargon and overly complicated wording.
Let your design work speak for itself, using descriptions to provide context and highlight your process. Proofread carefully or ask a friend to review your writing for errors.
