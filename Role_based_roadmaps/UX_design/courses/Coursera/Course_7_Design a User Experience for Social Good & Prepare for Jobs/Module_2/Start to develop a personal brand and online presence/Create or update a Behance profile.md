Online communities focused on UX design are a great place to connect with UX designers and potential employers. In this reading, you'll review how to set up a profile on a popular community called 
Behance
 and get some tips for how to get started using this platform.

On Behance, you can learn from other designers and be inspired by their work, or you can showcase your own UX work and get feedback.

Explore profiles on Behance
Understanding how other UX designers set up their own Behance profiles can help inspire your own. Before setting up a new profile, it’s a good practice to check out at least three profiles on the homepage to notice how they are set up and what they include. Here are a couple of Behance profile examples from Google to check out:

Sign up and fill in profile details
If you don’t have a Behance profile yet, follow these simple steps to sign up:

Navigate to the 
Behance
 home page.

Click the blue Sign Up button in the upper-left corner of the screen.

Fill out the details for the profile, like email address and a password.

Write a bio
A Behance bio is a professional introduction. It is a best practice to keep it short and only include information that professional connections should know about the designer and their work.

Link to other online profiles
Most designers have other professional online profiles (such as LinkedIn, an Instagram Business Account, or their own portfolio website), and will link to them in their Behance profile. This way, people can explore their skills and work and also contact them in multiple ways for networking.

If a designer already has a portfolio website, it’s recommended to include a link to their Behance profile. To link a Behance profile to a website, follow 
these steps
.

Upload projects (optional)
The Behance profile is a great place to showcase  a designer’s best UX work, but you should avoid including every project you’ve ever completed. Instead, showcase a few projects that are examples of your best work, especially the type of work you’d like to be hired for. 

Connect with UX professionals. After completing a Behance profile, designers can connect with other professionals on the platform in the following ways:

Follow artists whose work they enjoy. This creates a connection, and the followed artist may return the favor by following back!

Use Behance “appreciations” and comments to show admiration and support of work. This helps a designer build an online community of people whose work they like.

Use Behance to connect with UX designers or with people who work at specific companies where they want to work. To send a message on Behance, click the Message button on the left side of the person’s profile. Below is a template that can be used as a guide for what to say:

Hi [connection’s name], 

It’s nice to connect with you on Behance. [If you know the person, explain your connection here, such as if you went to school together, are part of the same religious community, or know each other in another way. If you are messaging someone you don’t know, skip this step and instead begin with a greeting.]

I’m starting a career as a UX designer, and I admire your work. [Reference specific projects they've done that you find inspiring, and why.]

I want to learn more about your role at [company name], and I was wondering if I could discuss with you at some point. When would be a good time to connect?

Sincerely,

[Your name]

Key takeaways
Having a Behance profile allows you to showcase your UX projects. If you don’t have UX projects yet, don’t worry. Start by creating your profile, and then it’s easy to update your profile, add new skills, add other experiences related to UX design, and even add the completed projects from this certificate program!

Behance is not only a great tool for displaying your work but also for connecting with others, such as potential employers, clients, and fellow designers. This ensures you are always prepared to network and reach out, whether you're actively seeking new job opportunities, maintaining connections within the field, or seeking inspiration for your work.
