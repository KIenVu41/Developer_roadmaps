Defining Your Personal Brand

Your personal brand should be reflected across your portfolio, social media, online communities, and job search websites.
A personal statement, which is a catchy one- or two-sentence phrase describing what you do and stand for, is a key element of your personal brand.
Maintaining Consistency

Use the same professional photo across all platforms to help recruiters easily identify you.
Ensure your color scheme, logo, font, and other design elements are consistent across your online platforms and physical products like business cards.
Reflecting Your Brand Through Your Work

Your work should exemplify the qualities and skills highlighted in your personal statement.
If you're passionate about a specific area of design, showcase it in your portfolio, even if it's not your own design, and explain why it inspires you.
