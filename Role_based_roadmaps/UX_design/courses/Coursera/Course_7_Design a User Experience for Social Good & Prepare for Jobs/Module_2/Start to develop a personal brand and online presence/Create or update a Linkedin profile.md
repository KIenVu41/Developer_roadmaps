Social media can be a great way to connect with potential employers, learn about new concepts and ideas, and network with other UX designers. For now, you'll focus on one of the most important social media sites for networking and boosting your job search: 
LinkedIn
.

LinkedIn is a professional networking site where you can connect with people you know, learn about companies, read about interesting ideas, and post your own content. You can use your LinkedIn profile to showcase your personal brand and industry goals. In short, LinkedIn is your online resume, where like-minded professional contacts can find you.

In this reading, you'll explore:

Explore other UX designers' profiles on LinkedIn
Find inspiration in how other UX designers create their own LinkedIn profiles. You can start by going to 
LinkedIn
 and typing “UX designer” into the search bar. You can also explore some of these Google UX designers' profiles:

Shabnam Kashani's profile

Nicolas Pellegrino's profile

Tongfang Sun's profile

Kartik Rao's profile

As you review these profiles, you can make notes about them to help you fill out your own profile later. You can use the 
LinkedIn comparison template
 to take notes.

If you take notes in the template or elsewhere, be sure to save the profile URLs so you can revisit them later. There’s space to save the URLs in the top row of the template.

Sign up for your own LinkedIn profile
If you have a LinkedIn profile, you can skip this step. If you don’t have a LinkedIn profile, now’s the time to create one! Successful designers typically create profiles as early as possible. With a profile in place, you can make changes and updates as you learn new skills or finish new projects. When you’re ready, go to the 
LinkedIn
 home page and create an account. For more detailed instructions on how to create a profile, read this article: “
Signing Up to Join LinkedIn
.”

Add or update your headshot
Using a professional profile picture is one way to seem credible and serious. In their article, “
Make a Great First Impression with Your LinkedIn Profile Photo
,” LinkedIn reports that users with a profile photo can get up to 21 times more profile views than members without a photo. You don’t need to go to a professional photographer to create a professional headshot. You can take one with a smartphone or personal camera, but ensure that your headshot:

Is a high-resolution photo

Is shot in portrait orientation, rather than landscape 

Has a non-distracting background

Shows you from the chest-up 

Is well-lit 

Features you looking at the camera, with your face as the photo’s focus

Write or update your headline
Your LinkedIn headline is the first thing that appears under your name and photo on your profile. It should clearly and concisely describe who you are and your skillset in UX. If you are just starting as a student in UX or are making a career transition, you can start your headline with “UX designer in training” and follow it with the expertise you’d like to highlight. For example, it’s a good idea to mention your creativity and organizational skills.

Fill in or update your About section
After you’ve added or updated your headshot and headline, it’s time to complete or update your 
About section
. This is where you list your job history or other professional experiences, along with descriptions of your role at each organization. Until you’re further along in your UX design career, it’s okay to simply list the places where you’ve worked and your job title. When you’re ready to start the job search, you can add more details about your work experience.

Connect with others on LinkedIn
Once your profile is created or updated, you’re ready to start connecting with other people and making some new connections! To add a connection, click the Connect button at the top of the person's profile. This will send a note to the person that says, “I’d like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.” 

If you’re sending a LinkedIn message to someone you know, remind the recipient how you know them and explain why you’re reaching out. If you’d like, use this template for your message:


Hi [connection’s name], 

It’s good to see you on LinkedIn. [It’s a good idea to then explain your relationship to the person here—whether you went to middle school together, are part of the same religious community, or know each other in another way.]

I’m starting my career as a UX designer, and I really like your company’s work. [It’s a good idea to reference specific projects the company’s done that you like, and why.]

I want to learn more about your role at [company name], and I was wondering if I could talk with you at some point. When would be a good time to connect?

Sincerely,

[Your name]


Once they accept, you’ll get a LinkedIn notification that you two are connected!

If you want to work at a specific company, you can also consider connecting with employees at that company.

A good way to reach out to those people is to browse the LinkedIn profiles of people associated with the company to find out if you know anyone who currently works there or worked there in the past. If you don’t know anyone at the company, that’s okay too. You can still send a message asking if they’d be willing to have a 15-minute conversation about the day-to-day tasks at their job and how they like working at the company. 

If you’d like, use the following template when sending a LinkedIn request to a person you don’t know:


Hi [connection’s name],

My name is [your name]. I’m a UX designer in training, and I really like your company’s work. [It’s a good idea to reference specific projects the company’s done that you like, and why.]

I want to learn more about your role at [company name], and I was wondering if I could talk with you at some point?

Sincerely,

[Your name]


To make more connections, you can also join a 
LinkedIn Group
. These are groups of people in a particular industry, or who share a specific interest. There are dozens of groups already dedicated to UX design, so join one or two that interest you. Get involved in the group conversation, then feel free to connect with folks in the group and start networking.

Key takeaways
An up-to-date LinkedIn profile is a crucial tool for reaching interested employers and clients and sharing your UX design experiences. If you create or update your profile now, you can continue to update it as you learn new skills, complete new projects, or grow your UX design experiences in other ways. This way, you’ll always be ready to reach out and network, whether you’re actively looking for new jobs or just working to stay connected with others in the field. Good luck!
