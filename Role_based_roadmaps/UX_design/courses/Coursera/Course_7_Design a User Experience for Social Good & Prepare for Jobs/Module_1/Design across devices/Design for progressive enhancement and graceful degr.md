Progressive Enhancement (Bottom-Up)

This approach prioritizes design for the smallest screen size first, like mobile phones, and then enhances the design for larger screens.
It ensures that the most important content is highlighted from the start and helps create a clear vision for how the website will appear on different devices.
Graceful Degradation (Top-Down)

This approach starts with designing for the largest screen size, like desktop computers, and then scales back features and interactions for smaller screens.
It was a popular approach when desktop computers were the primary devices used to access the internet.
Choosing the Right Approach

The best approach depends on the target audience and their primary device usage.
For users in emerging markets or frequent online shoppers, a progressive enhancement (mobile-first) approach might be more suitable.
For users who primarily use desktop computers, a graceful degradation approach might be more appropriate.
