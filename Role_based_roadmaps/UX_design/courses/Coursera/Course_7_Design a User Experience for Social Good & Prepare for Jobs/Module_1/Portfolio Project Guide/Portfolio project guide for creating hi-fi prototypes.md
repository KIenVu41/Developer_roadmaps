You’ve reviewed how to test lo-fi prototypes, synthesize the results of your research, and apply those results to modify your designs. Once your lo-fi designs have been refined (and retested as necessary), it’s time to build high-fidelity mockups so you can assemble them into a working hi-fi prototype for further testing and refinement.

Process flow of design thinking framework: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Prototype is highlighted.
This hi-fi prototyping phase is especially exciting because it’s when designs really start to come to life! Building on your previous work, you’ll craft your product’s look, feel, and flow through a series of design decisions about key visual and interactive elements. This guide breaks those decisions down into a series of activities.

Use this guide as a reference for your final portfolio project or any design project. For a deeper review of each activity, including examples, return to Courses 5 and 6 in the certificate and check out the additional resources linked in the sections below.



Prepare to work on your mockups
Before you start mocking up individual screens in your product, consider taking a few steps to prepare your Figma file and make your design work more efficient.

Create a page and frames in Figma 
First, review your lo-fi prototype and the wireframes you created for each screen. Then, create spaces for these screens in the Figma file for your project. Take the following steps:

Create a new page
 for your mockups within the Figma file

Name the page something that will help you identify it later

Create frames
 within the page for each screen you will mock up

Name each frame based on the screen it will represent

When you’re ready to start building a screen mockup, use the corresponding wireframe as a reference. It should show you exactly where you’d planned to place key elements such as text, visuals, and buttons.

*Pro Tip* 

Creating pages and frames for your hi-fi mockups is important work that doesn’t require a lot of creative or intellectual energy. If possible, consider saving a task like this one for a time when you need a break from more challenging tasks. Experienced designers often sequence their work like this, finding ways to be productive while preserving energy and focus for the creative tasks that need it most.

Create a sticker sheet 
If you haven’t already, take time to create a sticker sheet (or design kit) on a new Figma page where you can define and save reusable design elements, such as your typography, color palette, buttons, and icons. Remember that sticker sheets enable you to:

Copy assets from the sticker sheet and paste them into the design 

Share the sticker sheets with teammates and other collaborators

Update all instances of an asset by updating the original in the sticker sheet

To add an asset to a sticker sheet, you should save it as a component in Figma using the Create Component function. To review how, return to Course 5 in the certificate or check out this Figma Learn article on how to 
Create components to reuse in designs
.

Remember, too, that sticker sheets are a great place to define your product’s larger design system. A design system is a series of reusable elements and guidelines that allow teams to design and develop a product following predetermined standards. Not all designers and teams use design systems, but they tend to make designs better and the design process more efficient.

*Pro Tip*

It’s a good practice to have a design system and sticker sheet started before you start creating your mockups, but that doesn’t mean you must have all your reusable assets designed in advance. You can populate and refine your design system and sticker sheet as you make design choices during the mockup process. 

Add grids
Recall that grids will help you place and align text, icons, and other components in your mockups. They’re helpful tools for arranging components neatly, consistently, and efficiently across mockup screens.

For refreshers on how to create and use grids, check out these articles from Figma:

Everything you need to know about layout grids

Also, remember that Figma offers additional features to help you:

Adjust alignment, rotation, and position
 for single or multiple components at once

Explore auto layout properties
 to create designs that adjust automatically

*Pro Tip*

Grids and related features, like auto layout, help designers make precise choices about where to place elements and how to align them. Some designers prefer to make these kinds of choices during the later stages of the mockup process, after they have added many of their screens’ elements and roughly decided where to place them. And the same is true for many other kinds of precise design choices, like choosing a specific shade of a color or selecting the exact font for a heading. If you are not ready to make these kinds of choices when you first encounter them or when they first occur to you, you can always save them for a later time. In the meantime, make a provisional choice or add a temporary placeholder, and move on.

Review the earlier phases of your design process
When you create mockups, you’ll make a whole host of design decisions that will shape your users’ experiences in meaningful ways. So, take time to review the key parts of your design process, such as:

Business requirements

User personas and problem statements

Usability study results

You’ll want to have your users’ needs, goals, and pain points in mind as you design your mockups so you can ensure you’re creating an experience that is easy, enjoyable, and engaging in the long term. You’ll also want to have key business requirements in mind, such as relevant parts of a client’s brand.

*Pro Tip*

Do you remember the telephone game? A sentence gets whispered down a chain of people, and the final version is usually very different from the original because you can’t ask anyone to repeat it before you share it with the next person. When designers aren’t careful, their design work can play out like a game of telephone: The final product doesn’t align with the project’s original goals because the designers didn’t refer back to foundational parts of the design process, like their business requirements or problem statements. To avoid this outcome in your own designs, always make sure to review your earlier design work before making new rounds of design decisions.



Build your mockups
This section reviews the key visual design decisions you’ll have to make as you build your mockups, such as defining your product’s typography, adding icons, and creating dividers and other forms of containment around sections.

This section presents a series of design decisions in what looks like a sequence, but there’s no one right order or approach for tackling these decisions in your mockups. As you gain more experience in UX design, you’ll find that designers often adapt their approaches for different projects and situations. You’ll also probably find an approach you tend to prefer or default to. 

Add typography 
As you’ve learned, typography refers to how designers use typefaces and fonts to create meaning and guide users’ experiences. When used well, typography can direct users’ attention, create hierarchy among information, make text accessible, and convey your product’s brand.

When you add typography to your mockups, aim to create a clear typographic hierarchy that is readable, consistent, and reflective of your product’s brand. For example, consider the following typography from the Zia’s Pizza app:

Defined typographical choices for Zia’s Pizza app.
In this typography, the designer uses combinations of different typefaces and fonts to quickly show users key relationships between different pieces of information. For example, the app’s Logo appears in a dynamic serif typeface and a large font. This typography is designed to grab users’ attention and convey the app’s brand. But many users may find it unreadable across long passages, so the designer has reserved it for a limited and important use. In contrast, the app’s Body text appears in a sans serif typeface and a smaller font. It is less attention-grabbing but more readable across longer passages of text. 

For a deeper review of the typefaces, fonts, and other text properties available in Figma, check out this article: 
Figma Learn: Explore text properties
.

Once you settle on your product’s typography, consider defining it with a key like the one in the example above: showcase your typographical choices in a special frame in your Figma file. This way, you can apply the same typographical choices across all your mockups. This consistency is key for users who read by sight. It helps them quickly identify key pieces of information, like Headers, and understand how they relate to the other information.

*Pro Tip*

You can also set and reuse your design’s typographical styles in Figma. Check out this guide: 
Figma Learn: Create and apply text styles
. 

Add color 
Use color in your mockups to add emphasis, create variety, promote accessibility, and communicate your product’s branding. As you select a color palette for your mockups, remember to follow the 60-30-10 rule:

60% should be one neutral color 

30% should be a complementary color

10% should be an accent color 

Once your palette is defined, apply it in ways that promote an easy, enjoyable, and meaningful experience for users. For example, consider the following Zia’s Pizza app mockups, one without color and one with color:

Two Figma Frames: An order screen for Zia’s Pizza in black and white, and another in white, pastel red, and pastel green.
In the mockup with color, the designer uses white as their neutral (60%), pastel pink and pastel green as their complementary colors (30%), and bright red as their accent color (10%). Notice how the white and pastel colors work together to frame and draw attention to different sections on the screen, while the accent color draws attention to key information and calls to action.

*Pro Tip*

As with so many rules and best practices in UX design, the 60-30-10 rule is not a rigid formula but a flexible guideline that you can modify as needed. If you stray from the rule, just make sure that you’re doing it to meet users’ needs and convey your product’s brand.

Material Design: Applying color to UI

Add buttons and icons 
As you’ve learned, buttons and icons are types of so-called affordances: They hint at an element’s purpose in the product and so “afford” users the opportunity to interact with that element. Put simply, affordances are essential for enabling users to identify and engage with a product’s interactive elements. They can also help you save space, showcase your product’s brand, make products more accessible, and transition users to new information and new locations within the product.

When you add buttons and icons to your mockups:

Decide where to place them. Identify where you can condense headers, calls to action, or other important pieces of information into buttons or simple icons.

Use industry-standard shapes and images to represent common product elements, like Home screens. You can import them with this 
free Material Design plugin for Figma
.

Design custom buttons or icons only if you need them for an important purpose. Consider the design principles discussed on the 
Material Design website
.

*Pro Tip* 

As visual symbols, icons can make products more accessible by breaking down language barriers and conveying important information through commonly recognized images. But icons can have the opposite effect if they lack alt text or rely on imagery that is specific to certain cultures or regions. Ensure you select or design inclusive icons and add alt text to be read by screen readers.

Create containment 
Containment means using visual barriers to keep designs neat and organized. When used effectively, barriers can convey a product’s brand and make it easier to understand and navigate.

Remember that UX designers typically use four kinds of barriers:

Dividers: Single lines that separate sections or components

Borders: Sets of divider lines that typically form full or partial shapes, like squares or rectangles

Fill: A color feature within borders 

Shadow: An effect that creates dimension, often used in combination with borders or fill

As you add containers to your mockups, make sure they are both helpful for users and consistent with your other design choices, such as your product’s color palette. In the example below, for instance, the Zia’s Pizza app designer has used the pink pastel color from their color palette to create a container for the TODAY’S TOP PIZZA section. 

Two close-up comparison images of Zia’s Pizza mockups. The left example has no divider line or clear separation of sections.
This fill not only highlights that important section for users but also aligns with the branding of the bright red Zia’s Pizza logo and Add to order button.

For fill, check out

Adjust negative space
In addition to containment, negative space is another powerful tool for making your designs more usable. Remember that negative space can show relationships between components, draw attention to important components, help users focus, and increase the visibility and readability of your design’s images and text.

You will naturally create negative space as you add components to your mockups, but take time to adjust that negative space in places where more or less space will improve users’ experience. Focus on:

Line spacing, the vertical space between two pieces of text

Padding, the negative space around elements or between borders and other elements

Margins, the space outside the border of the design



Refine hi-fi mockups
Once your mockups have the fundamental elements of their visual design in place, you can refine those elements by applying advanced visual design principles, Gestalt principles, and planning for gestures and motion.

Apply visual design principles 
Visual design principles can make your designs more usable, enjoyable, and meaningful. They include emphasis, hierarchy, scale and proportion, and unity and variety. As you refine your mockups, apply visual design principles by asking these questions:

Emphasis: Which elements should users notice first? Use size, contrast, texture, color, and other design elements to emphasize the information, sections, or components you want to grab users’ attention.

Hierarchy: Which elements are more important and which are less important? Organize and emphasize elements so that the most important pieces of information are the most visually prominent.

Scale and proportion: How do different elements relate to one another? Scale elements so that more important ones are larger than less important ones. And keep scaled elements proportional to ensure all elements on screen appear balanced.

Unity and variety: How can I ensure the design looks unified while not being monotonous? Use typography, icons, color, and other design elements to make the design look consistent and coherent while allowing important elements to stand out.

*Pro Tip*

Notice how all these seemingly different visual design principles all work together: They should all be used to guide users’ attention and convey the product’s brand. If you ever find yourself struggling to juggle multiple visual principles, you can always come back to these guiding questions: Why is the user engaging with this product? What will they most want or need to pay attention to first, second, third, and so on?

Apply Gestalt principles
As a reminder, Gestalt principles describe how the human brain tends to subconsciously make sense of the objects it perceives. When you understand and apply these principles to your designs, you can create smoother and more enjoyable experiences for users. As you refine your mockups, find opportunities to rearrange, reshape, recombine, and resize components to satisfy these Gestalt principles:

Similarity: When components look similar, we tend to think they have the same function 

Proximity: When components are close together, we tend to think they are related 

Common region: When components are located in the same area or section, we tend to think they are a related unit or group 

Closure: When components appear to form an incomplete shape, we tend to perceive the shape as a complete whole

Continuity: When components are arranged in a line or along a curve, we tend to perceive them as related

Symmetry: When components are symmetrical, we tend to find them visually pleasing and perceive them as related or balanced

Asymmetry: When components are asymmetrical, we tend to perceive them as important or emphasized

Remember that, as with symmetry and asymmetry, the other Gestalt principles work in reverse too. For example, while you can use the principles of proximity and common region to group related components together, you can also do the opposite and show distinctions by placing less related components further apart or in separate areas.

Plan gestures and motion
Before you assemble your hi-fi mockups into a working prototype, a final step is to plan for the gestures and motion you want users to experience in your product. Recall that gestures are interactions in which users engage with a product through touch, such as swiping, dragging, tapping, and pinching. Motion is a way to animate static design elements to focus the user’s attention and tell stories. 

Remember that different kinds of operating systems, such as Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, support different kinds of gestures. This is because they are based on different design philosophies and different design guidelines:

iOS is based on the 
Human Interface Guidelines
, or HIG 

Android is based on 
Material Design

As a designer, it’s your job to understand these guidelines and test your products on different kinds of devices to ensure they work in different operating systems.

Add navigation menus
There's one more thing to consider: the navigation menu that will help users move through the product. Designing your product with a simple, intuitive menu is essential for providing a good user experience. Before you design this menu, ask yourself: Which pages will users most want or need to access quickly, from anywhere in the product? Once you’ve identified these pages, consider which menu (or which combination of menus) will best suit your users’ needs and your project’s business requirements:

Navigation bars are vertical or horizontal bars that display links to a product’s most important pages. They’re usually accessible from all or most pages in the product. For more guidance, check out Creative Momentum’s article on 
Designing the Ideal Navigation Bar
.

Tab bars are similar to navigation bars, but they display page links as tabs that toggle on and off as users move onto or off the corresponding pages. Tab bars show which page the user is on, so they’re especially helpful when users want or need to track where they are in a product. For an example, check out Googler Kartik’s Google Clock app design on Kartik’s
 portfolio website
.

Navigation menus—also known as “hidden” menus or “hamburger” menus—are menus that appear when users click a three-line icon on the edge of the screen, usually in the top left or top right. They’re easy to locate, and they hide the menu when users don’t need it. For more guidance, check this resource from Enginess about 
Hidden menus in Mobile and Web Design
. 

Navigation hubs display collections of links on a product’s homepage. Users typically have to visit the homepage any time they want to access a new page. This kind of navigation menu is typically best for relatively simple products that don’t have many pages for users to navigate. For an example, check out Googler 
Tongfang’s portfolio website
.



Create a high-fidelity prototype 
Once your mockups are built and refined, it’s time to connect them into a working prototype:

Arrange your mockups in the navigational order that your prototype will follow. Make sure your screens are in a logical order that supports the user journey you mapped out earlier in the design process.

Create interactions by connecting your mockup screens. Select the Prototype tab in the right sidebar and drag connection nodes between the screens you want to connect. For each connection, start with the interactive element on the first screen (the trigger) and end with the screen where that trigger will take the user (the destination).

Select the animations you want to add to your interactions. Use the interaction details panel in Figma, and experiment with different animation types to make your prototype seem as realistic as possible.

Preview interactions by using the Present button in the top-right corner of the Figma toolbar. Verify that each interaction’s gesture and motion make navigation clear, simple, and delightful for the user.

Save your prototype and share it by clicking Share Prototype in the top right of your screen in Figma. Make sure your prototype is named appropriately. Then, set your link access to “Anyone with the link” and your share settings to “can view.” When you’re finished, select “copy link.” This will generate a link to your prototype so your peers can view it.

Create interactions
.

*Pro Tip*

After you finish your hi-fi prototype, take some time to reflect on your hard work and celebrate! This is an important milestone in any design project. When designers take time to reflect and celebrate, they often find they’re more focused and energized for their next tasks. Think of reflection, celebration, and break time as important parts of your creative process, not just as time off. We need breaks to recharge physically, emotionally, and creatively.



A final checklist
After finishing your hi-fi prototype, you’ll test it with another usability study and refine it based on the results of your study. The more refined a prototype is, the better your results will be. So before you move on, make sure you have:

Built mockups for each screen you want to include in your prototype

Included typography, color, containment, and other fundamental design elements

Refined your prototypes with visual design principles and Gestalt principles

Added navigational and interactive features, such as buttons, icons, and menus

Connected your mockup screens in a logical and user-friendly order 

Added animations to simulate interactions

As always, be sure to save evidence of your prototyping work for your portfolios and job interviews!
