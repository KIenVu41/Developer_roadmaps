You’ve reviewed how to create effective wireframes and prototypes, and now it’s time to test and modify those prototypes based on user feedback. Effective UX design is intensively iterative from start to finish, and nowhere more so than in the prototyping and testing phases of the process. When designers create prototypes, they typically go through multiple rounds of designing, testing, and modifying to arrive at designs that work best for users.

Process flow of design thinking framework: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Test is highlighted.
This is an especially iterative part of the design process, so to help you, this guide will review how to:

Plan usability studies

Conduct usability studies

Synthesize and prioritize usability study results

Apply those results in modifying designs

Plan a usability study
Usability studies, also known as usability testing, are research methods that assess how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a product. When done well, they will help you and your teams understand how users interact with your designs and how well your product meets their needs. Because usability studies can be relatively inexpensive, they’re a “low risk, high reward” way to test designs! 

UX research plans 
To prepare for a usability study, create a plan with the UX research plan template. To access the template, see the Appendix at the end of this reading. 

Start by clarifying your research goals. Then craft the rest of your plan to align with those goals. The following is a brief review of the plan’s key elements.

Research goals: These goals will depend on where you are in the design process and the information you need to build or refine your designs. In a usability study for a prototype, for example, your research goals should be to assess how users think, feel, and behave while interacting with your prototype, including how easy it is for them to complete the main user flow and achieve their goals.

Research questions: These questions should reflect your research goals and target the information you need to achieve those goals. Aim for 5–10 questions total, depending on how much information you need. (If you want to investigate more than 10 questions, you may have multiple research goals that need separate studies.)

Key performance indicators (KPIs): These indicators are the metrics you’ll use to answer your research questions. They include users’ time on task, use of navigation versus search, user error rates, drop-off rates, conversion rates, and so on.

Methodology: This section should describe how you will collect and analyze the information you’re targeting with your research questions. Provide enough detail for fellow researchers (or your future self) to understand what you did, why you made those choices, and what your study’s limitations were.

Participants: This section should describe who will participate in the study, their key characteristics, and why you chose them. If you intentionally include participants from specific populations, such as users with disabilities, explain why.

Script: Plan out the questions you will ask participants. Make sure they are relevant to your research goals, clearly phrased in plain language, neutral rather than leading, and open-ended and conversational to invite sharing and follow-up from participants.

In addition to these elements, research plans typically start with introductions that include the study’s research goals. Before delivering these goals, introductions usually specify the study’s title, author, stakeholders, date, and project background.

Considerations for usability studies
The elements of a research plan will be different depending on why the research is being conducted. For a usability study in particular, consider the following questions and incorporate your answers into your plan:

User tasks: What tasks should users perform to test the prototype? 

These should be the tasks users need to complete to successfully navigate your product and achieve their goals. Outline them in your research plan’s methodology. They will become prompts you give participants so you can observe how they interact with the product.

Representative participants: What kinds of participants will represent your product’s target users? 

Ideally, you should recruit participants who resemble our project’s user personas and have some of their key characteristics. If you use specific methods to recruit representative participants, explain those methods in your plan’s methodology.

Moderation: Will the study be moderated or unmoderated? 

Answer this question and explain your reasons in your research plan’s methodology.

Moderated studies have moderators guide participants through the studies’ tasks in real time. They are best for building rapport with participants and asking follow-up questions that dig into the details of users’ experiences. 

Unmoderated studies have participants test the prototypes without human guidance. This unguided approach allows participants to simulate how they would interact with the product outside the study in everyday situations. Unmoderated studies are typically recorded on video so researchers can watch them later

*Pro Tip* 

Skilled designers always plan their studies carefully. But they don’t necessarily polish their plans’ language, organization, and formatting unless they need to share those plans with important stakeholders. For example, your study scripts should always be polished because they contain questions you’ll deliver to participants. But if you don’t plan to share the rest of your plan with stakeholders, you may not need to spend time refining and polishing the whole thing. Do that kind of polishing only when you need to share the plan with a wider audience that will expect it, such as clients and other business stakeholders.



Conduct a usability study
To conduct an effective usability study, you need a method for taking notes. You also need some best practices for connecting with users and prompting them to share useful information. 

Taking notes
Experienced UX designers typically use a template for taking notes during research studies. When you use the same template, you’re more consistent in the way you gather and record information from participant to participant. This consistency will make your data more useful and reliable. 

See the Usability study note-taking spreadsheet template in the Appendix of this reading. It provides spaces for you to record information about participants’ experiences with each task in your usability study. This information includes:

The click path the participant uses to complete the task

Observations about the participant’s behaviors, opinions, attitudes, and so on

Quotes that reflect or showcase key parts of the participant’s experience

A scale for ranking the ease with which the participant completed the task

Extra notes to record what the participant shares after the tasks are complete

*Pro Tip* 

Experienced designers often tailor their note-taking templates to best suit their research goals and questions. If you create a tailored note-taking template, just make sure that you use the template, communicate the tasks, and record your observations in the same way for each participant. Consistency is key for gathering useful and reliable data!

Best practices
Before you conduct your first usability study, keep these five best practices in mind: get comfortable, put people first, don’t skip the paperwork, communicate clearly, and ask the right questions. All these best practices will help you connect with participants and better understand their unique experiences and perspectives.

Icons and labels for each best practice.
Get comfortable: Participants in a usability study provide the best feedback when they feel comfortable with the moderator. 

Put people first: Throughout the study, focus on the participants themselves and communicate your respect and value for them. 

Don’t skip the paperwork: Once participants have settled in, you need to take care of some paperwork, such as asking participants to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).

Communicate clearly: Throughout the study, communicate clearly by using plain, conversational language and pausing to ask what questions participants have.

Ask the right questions: Make sure they are relevant to your research goals, neutral and open-ended, and framed the same way for each participant.

*Pro Tip* 

Conducting user interviews and usability studies is an extremely valuable UX design skill that takes practice to develop and hone. So, practice! Once you plan your study, consider running an informal rehearsal or mock study with friends, family, or colleagues acting as participants. Ask for their feedback on your performance and identify areas for improvement. You may want to practice your small-talk skills, your follow-up questions, and so on. During UX design job interviews, most potential employers will love to learn how you took the initiative to test your skills, gather feedback, and improve.



Synthesize results and modify designs
Once you have conducted your usability study and completed your notes, it’s time to generate insights you can use to improve your designs. Insights are observations that change and deepen your understanding of your users and their needs. They help designers determine how different pieces of data relate. They also explain what the data means and what to do with it.

To move from research notes to insights, you should first gather all the data you collected during your research study. This might include recordings, notes, and so on. Next, you’ll need to organize that data, identify themes and patterns, and turn those patterns into actionable insights you can apply to your designs.

Organize your data
One classic tool for organizing research data is an affinity diagram. To create an affinity diagram, start by setting up a physical or virtual whiteboard. For virtual whiteboards, you can use the options listed in the Appendix below. Next, take every observation from your notes and add it to a physical or virtual sticky note. Then, cluster your sticky notes based on their similarities or affinities. There is no specific method here, so allow the clusters to emerge organically. Some notes may not fit neatly into your clusters, and that’s OK. Once your observations are clustered, review the clusters and adjust them to better reflect the similarities in the data. Finally, review your completed affinity diagram and rearrange as needed. You may find that you can combine or split certain clusters. You may also find that new clusters emerge.

It’s really hard to get actionable insights out of disorganized data, so take time and care with this stage in the process!

*Pro Tip* 

As with so many parts of the design process, affinity diagramming often works best when you take breaks. Skilled designers typically pause periodically, especially between the initial clustering phase and the review phase. With fresh eyes, you may notice things you wouldn’t have noticed otherwise.

Identify patterns and themes
Once your data is organized into clusters, identify the patterns and themes that unite each cluster. Patterns are quantifiable relationships between observations, while themes are ideas that stem from and explain those patterns. For example, a pattern might be, “4 out of 5 participants had trouble finding the FAQ page,” while the theme behind might be, “This means the FAQ page is difficult to find for most users.” 

Your patterns and themes will shape your upcoming design decisions, so make sure they are clear and objective:

Express them in plain language that is easy to understand 

Limit each theme to just one idea. Data clusters with multiple sub-ideas can be broken into multiple themes

Focus on objective observations, and avoid adding commentary or opinion to your themes

See the Appendix at the end of this reading for a pattern identification template you can use to express your research themes consistently across clusters and ideas.

Create insights
Once you’ve identified patterns and themes in your data, the next step is to translate your themes into insights you can apply to your designs. Strong insights are statements that designers can act on: they state what should change in a design and why. For example, if a theme is “the FAQ page is difficult for most users to find,” then an insight might be, “The FAQ page should be relocated and relabeled to be easier to find.”

As you create your insights, make sure they:

Are based on real data (observations from your research)

Relate to or answer the research questions from your research plan

Are straightforward and easy to understand

Increase empathy for the user experience

Inspire direct changes within your design

To create your insights, use the insight identification template in the Appendix at the end of this reading.

*Pro Tip* 

If you find yourself developing lots of insights and wondering how you’ll address them all, remember that design is an iterative process. Designers typically modify and test their designs multiple times before moving on to other parts of the design process. You don’t have to implement all your insights in one round of modifications. Instead, you can pace out your modifications over multiple rounds of redesigning and testing.

Prioritize and apply your insights
Once you develop your insights, you will probably have more than you can implement at one time. So, now’s the time to prioritize your insights into Priority 0 (P0), Priority 1 (P1), and Priority 2 (P2). The following is a brief refresher on these three priority levels: 

P0 insights are more urgent insights that must be implemented or addressed for your product to:

Function properly and enable users to complete the main user flow

Be equitable and accessible to all users

Avoid making users feel tricked or misled

When they modify their designs, design teams typically start with P0 insights so they can update and retest their prototypes before making less urgent changes. But before you start implementing your P0 insights, take time to divide the rest of your insights into P1 and P2.

P1 and P2 insights are less urgent insights that designers choose to save for later rounds of updating and retesting. While not as urgent as P0 insights, they will nevertheless address user pain points and improve the overall user experience. P1 insights are a higher priority than P2. Designers typically rank P1 and P2 insights based on a variety of factors, like the amount of time they have to update their designs and which updates will most improve users’ experiences. 

*Pro Tip*

When designers and other stakeholders rank insights, it’s the designers’ responsibility to prioritize and advocate for users’ needs. This is especially important when it comes to the needs of groups that have been historically underrepresented in user studies. To create equitable and accessible designs, designers must reach out to user groups whose experiences and needs have traditionally gone unconsidered or under-considered in design research.

Modify designs
When you have prioritized your insights, you’re ready to start modifying your designs. Start with P0 insights, and then implement as many P1 insights as you have time for. You may need to move some P1 insights into the P2 category. Consider which insights will have a lower impact on user experience—they may be appropriate for P2. Once you’ve made your P0 changes and most urgent P1 changes, you’ll ideally have time for another round of testing and modification. Then, it’s time to implement the remainder of your P1 and P2 insights.



A final checklist
After refining your lo-fi prototypes, you’ll move on to creating hi-fi mockups. Don’t rush the process: The more methodical you are in developing, testing, and refining your lo-fi prototypes, the better your hi-fi mockups and prototypes will be. Before you start working on those mockups, ask yourself whether you have:

Planned a usability study about user experiences with your lo-fi prototype

Conducted that usability study using best practices

Synthesized your usability study results using affinity diagrams

Translated those results into actionable insights

Prioritized those insights into P0, P1, and P2 buckets

Implemented your P0 and P1 insights and as many P2 insights as possible

If possible, you should retest and further refine your prototype as needed. Once these activities are complete, you’ll ideally have a lo-fi prototype in which users can achieve—or simulate achieving—their goals and complete the main user flow with ease and enjoyment. And be sure to save evidence of your prototyping and testing work for your portfolios and job interviews!
