Usability Studies and Prototyping

Usability studies are research methods used to evaluate the ease of use of a product. They provide insights that help UX designers improve their designs.
There are two types of usability studies: moderated, where a moderator guides participants, and unmoderated, where participants test prototypes independently.
High-Fidelity Prototype Testing Considerations

Brainstorm potential interaction issues users might encounter with the high-fidelity prototype, especially concerning complex interactions like overlays and motion.
Test the prototype on the appropriate platform and screen size to ensure compatibility with user expectations and platform conventions.
Carefully select study participants who represent the target audience, especially in social good projects, to gather authentic feedback.
