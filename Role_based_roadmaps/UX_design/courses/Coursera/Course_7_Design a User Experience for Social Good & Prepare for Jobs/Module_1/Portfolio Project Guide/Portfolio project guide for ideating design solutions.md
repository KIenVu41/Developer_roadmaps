You’ve reviewed how to use problem, hypothesis, and goal statements to define the user problems your design must address. Once those problems are clearly defined, it’s time to start imagining solutions! It’s the ideate phase of the design thinking process.

Process flow of design thinking framework: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Ideate is highlighted.
In the ideate phase of the design thinking process, remember that your first goal should be to imagine as many creative solutions as possible. Try not to pre-select or pre-judge any of them. Selection and judgment happen later, when you pick the best ideas to prototype. To help you get started, let’s review some key ideation activities: competitive audits, How might we, and Rapid sketching. 

In addition to generating lots of design ideas, these activities can also help you:

Grow your knowledge of your industry and competitors 

Stretch your ability for creative problem-solving

Understand existing design problems in new ways

For these reasons, consider keeping evidence of your ideation work to include in your design portfolios and discuss during UX design job interviews. This work can show your knowledge of the field and your capacity for creative thinking and problem-solving. And those are two qualities that UX design employers usually look for in applicants.

The following is a brief guide for completing each activity. Use it as a reference for your final portfolio project or any design project. For a deeper review of each activity, including examples, return to Course 2 in the certificate.



Competitive audits
Once you’ve set goals for how your product will meet user needs, it’s time to brainstorm design ideas that will achieve those goals. Competitive audits are a great way to start. With a competitive audit, designers research competitors to learn more about how they design similar products or serve similar users. Ideally, you’ll identify effective design elements to emulate in your product as well as design problems and pitfalls to avoid.

When you’re ready to conduct a competitive audit, access the competitive audit template in the Appendix below and take the following steps:

Outline the goals of your audit. To make the audit efficient and useful, first determine the outcome or goal you want to achieve. This goal should reflect the scope of your design project and the kind of information you need to ideate effective solutions to your users’ needs.

Identify direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors offer products that are similar to your product and focus on the same users. Indirect competitors offer similar products to a different set of users, or they focus on the same set of users and offer different products.

Determine the aspects of your competitors to investigate during your audit. Depending on the information they need, designers typically audit competitors by researching their products’ users, interactivity, flow, visual design, written content, and so on.

Conduct your audit and take thorough notes on those aspects of your competitors that you selected. Effective audits are consistent, meaning you should apply the same level of attention and thoroughness to each aspect of each competitor.

Summarize your findings in a report. The findings you include and how you present them will depend on your audit’s goals and audience. In your Capstone portfolio project, for example, your report might simply be an informal set of notes about your key findings. Whatever approach you take, be sure to highlight those findings that might shape your decisions in the upcoming phases of the design process.

*Pro Tip* 

Remember that competitive audits are useful for more than just the ideation phase of the design process. Designers also use formal and informal competitive audits to familiarize themselves with new industries, keep current with design trends, and learn about potential employers during the job application and interview process.



Ideation activities
After researching related products, you’re ready to start generating ideas for solving the problems and meeting the goals you outlined earlier in your problem and goal statements. The following are guidelines for two classic ideation techniques: How might we and Rapid sketching.

How might we
In a “How might we” (HMW) activity, you translate user problems, needs, or pain points into opportunities for design. By reframing problems as opportunities, designers often find that they have an easier time imagining a wider variety of design solutions.

To create good HMW questions, you need a well-defined problem statement. From there, you can reframe this problem statement into questions that will help you come up with ideas to solve the problem. To reframe the problem, apply perspectives like the following:

Amp up the good by asking, How might we take any positives in the problem and use them as solutions?

Explore the opposite by asking, How might we solve the opposite of the problem we’ve outlined?

Change the status quo by asking, How might we completely change the current process involved in the problem?

Break the point-of-view into pieces by asking, How might we create smaller solutions for the smaller parts of the larger problem?

Remove the bad by asking, How might we remove the negative part of the problem entirely?

Go after the adjective by asking, How might we take negative adjectives in the problem and turn them into positives?

Question an assumption by asking, How might we remove or change any processes that we assumed must be in place?

Create an analogy by asking, How might we make the user experience more like another kind of positive user experience?

Identify unexpected resources by asking, How might we solve the problem with resources or assets that aren’t part of the original problem statement?

As you develop and try to answer your own HMW questions, remember to keep your questions focused on the problem at hand, write as many questions as you can, revise or replace any questions that don’t prompt creative thinking, and have fun! HMW questions aren’t meant to help you elaborate on the details of one specific solution. Rather, they should stretch your understanding of the problem so you can imagine creative solutions that might otherwise have remained unconsidered. So, be flexible and get creative.

Rapid sketching
Rapid sketching (also known as “Crazy Eights”) is a great way to ideate in a visual and tactile way. To do this, you’ll sketch eight different ideas or designs for solving a single-user problem by following these steps.

Fold a large piece of paper in half three times so that unfolding it reveals eight rectangles.

Grab something to draw with. Use a marker, pen, or pencil—whatever you prefer or have available.

Set your timer to eight minutes. You’ll have one minute to sketch each design idea.

Let the ideas flow. Draw any solution that comes to your mind. If you have more than eight ideas, repeat the exercise.

Remember that Rapid sketching is often done in a group setting: Each person draws eight sketches on their own. Then the group identifies their favorite ideas, which are usually elaborated further in more detailed sketches. 

Whether you’re working alone or in a group, remember that effective ideation means suspending judgment while trying and failing multiple times. The initial goal is not to develop perfect ideas but to develop lots of ideas, no matter how unusual they seem. Once you’ve generated plenty of ideas, you and your teams can review them, select those you like best, and then start to refine and iterate further.

*Pro Tip* 

UX design employers typically value designers who can “think outside the box.” But what does thinking outside the box actually involve? And how do designers prove they can do it? It involves creative ideation techniques like How might we and Rapid sketching. Use these techniques in your design projects, keep evidence of your work, bring that evidence into your design portfolios, and discuss it during your job interviews. If you say you can think outside the box, you’ll be able to prove it!



A final checklist
Before you select ideas to prototype, pause to ensure you’ve researched the competition and ideated creative solutions. Ask yourself whether you have:

Identified direct and indirect competitors for your product

Researched relevant aspects of those competitors’ products

Summarized your research findings in a formal or informal audit report

Conducted a How might we (HMW) exercise to reframe problems as opportunities

Sketched ideas for solutions with Rapid sketching

Once these activities are complete, you’ll ideally have a set of design ideas to choose from. Be sure to save evidence of your ideation work for your portfolios and job interviews.
