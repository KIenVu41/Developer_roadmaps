You’ve reviewed how to do foundational empathy work for your current design project, including interviewing users, developing user personas, and mapping out user experiences and pain points. This guide takes you through the next phase of the design thinking process, where you’ll define goals for your design project.


In the define phase, remember that your guiding question should be: 

Which of my users’ needs or problems are the most important for my design to address? 

To answer this question, you’ll use problem statements, hypothesis statements, and, finally, goal statements.

In addition to setting a clear focus for your design project, these defining activities will also enhance your design portfolio. You can include elements of them in your portfolio website and in your case study presentations about specific design projects.

Use this guide as a reference for your Capstone portfolio project or any design project. For a deeper review of each activity, including examples, return to Course 2 in the certificate.



Problem statements
A problem statement concisely describes a user need that your design must address. When based in empathy and user research, problem statements help designers identify key goals, constraints, and criteria for their designs. Before you start ideating solutions to user needs in the next phase of the design process, problem statements help you and your teams agree on what those needs are and why they are important for users. 

In your final portfolio project or any design project, aim to create a problem statement for each of your user personas. You can use the following process:

Write the persona’s name

Add a short description of the persona’s user characteristics

Describe the persona’s need

Explain why the persona has that need

Remember that the user’s need and the “why” behind that need should form an actionable insight that you can address in your design. When combined, these four elements should fit into this problem statement template: 

[User name] is a/an [user characteristics] who needs [user need] because [insight].

Problem statement template with fillable spaces for user name, user characteristics, user need, and insight.
For example, the following is one of the problem statements for the dog-walker app design project you explored earlier in the certificate:

Arnold is a busy executive who needs an easy app experience to hire a dog walker because he’s not technologically savvy.

As you construct your problem statements, pause to review them and make improvements. Effective problem statements meet the following criteria. They are:

Human-centered and focused on what users need from the design

Broad enough to allow designers freedom to ideate creative solutions

Narrow enough to be solved with practical design solutions

To access the problem statement template, see the Appendix at the end of this course item.

*Pro Tip*

Problem statements are great elements to include in design portfolios and presentations because they show your ability to derive actionable insights from user research. This ability is often prized by UX design employers, who typically want to hire designers who base their design decisions on evidence about real users’ needs.



Hypothesis statements
While a problem statement describes a user need that the product must address, a hypothesis statement communicates the designer’s best educated guess about how to address that need. When done effectively, hypothesis statements help designers clarify what they want to achieve with their designs, which is key for the next phase of the design thinking process: ideating solutions to user needs.

To write a hypothesis statement for a user need, review the user’s problem statement and then:

Determine an action that could solve your user’s need.

Specify the outcome that you expect from the action.

This process often yields hypothesis statements that more or less fit this if/then template:

If [action], then [outcome].

If/then statement template with fillable spaces for action and outcome.
To access the hypothesis statement template, see the Appendix at the end of this course item.

*Pro Tip* 

Hypothesis statements aren’t just useful during the define phase of the design thinking process. Designers also use them during the test phase, when they research their designs’ effectiveness for users. Just as scientists run tests to validate their hypotheses in a research lab, so too will you test the usability of your designs to confirm whether they help users achieve the outcomes in your project’s hypothesis statements.



Goal statements
With goal statements, you take the action and outcome of a hypothesis statement and expand them to articulate a specific and measurable goal for the product you’re designing. This goal should address the need you identified earlier in your problem statement. 

A strong goal statement will:

Describe a specific action users can take or what the product will do

Define who the action will affect

State the positive impact of the action or why the product solves the user's need

Outline criteria for measuring the product’s success

To create a goal statement, you can use this template:

Our [product] will let users [perform specific actions], which will affect [describe who the action will affect] by [describe how the action will positively affect them]. We will measure effectiveness by [describe how you will measure the impact].

Goal statement template with fillable spaces for each goal-statement element.
Goal statements help designers solidify the scope of their design work by articulating exactly who their product will serve, what the product will do, why the product solves the user’s need, and how the effectiveness of that solution will be measured. With these decisions in place, designers are better prepared to create ideas for their product design.

To access the goal statement template, see the Appendix at the end of this course item.

*Pro-Tip* 

By helping designers solidify the scope of their designs, goal statements are vital tools for honoring a project’s business requirements. Before you start ideating design solutions for a professional design project, check to ensure your design goals and criteria align with the business goals and parameters laid out by your client or other business stakeholders. If they aren’t aligned, you may need to adjust your design goals, propose a change to the project’s business requirements, or both.



A final checklist
Before you move on to the next phase of the design thinking process, pause to make sure you’ve completed all the key defining activities for this phase. Ask yourself whether you have:

Crafted problem statements for each user persona

Crafted hypothesis statements for each problem statement

Crafted goal statements for each hypothesis statement

Ensured your goal statements align with any relevant business requirements.

Finally, take time to review your problem, hypothesis, and goal statements to ensure they are free of biases or assumptions. All should be firmly grounded in the information you gathered while interviewing users and crafting user personas.

Now you’re ready to start ideating design solutions to the problems you’ve defined!
