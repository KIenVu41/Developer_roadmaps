You’ve reviewed how to ideate design solutions to address user problems and help users meet their goals. Now it’s time to start bringing those solutions to life by prototyping them!

Process flow of design thinking framework: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Test is highlighted.
With prototyping, remember that designers often start with basic sketches or outlines of a product’s user flow and information architecture. From there, designers typically work up to more detailed prototypes that simulate the product’s user flow. To guide you through this process, this reading offers a refresher on how to create: 

User flow diagrams, storyboards, and sitemaps

Lo-fi prototypes with connected wireframes

Use this guide as a reference for your final portfolio project or any design project. For a deeper review of the lo-fi prototyping process, including examples, return to Course 3 in the certificate.



User flow, storyboards, and sitemaps
Before you do anything else in the prototyping phase, take time to review the problem statements and goal statements you developed during the define phase. Make sure you have some basic ideas about how users will move through the product to achieve their goals. Three tools will help: user flow diagrams, storyboards, and sitemaps.

*Pro Tip*

These three tools can also help you share your design ideas and get buy-in from business stakeholders. Designers often create working versions for their own needs and then create more polished versions for sharing with wider audiences. Before sharing these kinds of deliverables, check whether your audience wants to see working versions or polished versions. Some stakeholders may be fine with working versions, while others will want to review polished versions.

User flow diagrams
A user flow diagram helps you visually map the steps that users will take to interact with your product, complete key tasks, and achieve their goals. To develop a user flow, answer these questions:

What actions will users take in the product?

What decisions will users make?

What screens will users experience before and after taking action or making a decision?

As you answer these questions, use the user-flow shapes you explored in Course 3 to diagram the sequence of actions, decisions, screens, and flows that users will experience.

Green circle labeled action; orange rectangle labeled screen; blue diamond labeled decision; solid and dotted red lines.
Remember that circles represent the actions users take, rectangles represent the screens they encounter, diamonds represent the decisions they make, solid lines represent forward movement in the flow, and dotted lines represent backward movement.

To access the user flow template, see the Appendix at the end of this course item.

Storyboards
After diagraming your product’s main user flows, you can use storyboards to visualize user experiences in even more detail. Effective storyboards have the following elements:

A character who is using the product, ideally one of your user personas

A scene that shows the user’s environment, situation, or context 

A plot that shows the solution or benefit that the product offers the user

A narrative that shows the user’s need and how the design solves that need

Designers typically bring these elements to life with a series of simple sketches and text descriptions in a template like the following. To access the storyboard template, see the Appendix at the end of this reading.

Remember that you can use storyboards to show different perspectives on the user’s experience, including big-picture perspectives and close-up perspectives:

Big-picture storyboards focus on what the user needs, their situation, and how the product will address the user’s needs. They help you show users’ needs in context and highlight the positive outcomes of using the product. 

Close-up storyboards focus on the product itself and how it works. They are often a more visually detailed version of a user flow diagram, using sketches rather than simple shapes to show key actions, screens, and decision points. 

*Pro Tip*

Different kinds of storyboards can be more or less useful at different stages of the design process. Designers often use big-picture storyboards to empathize with users, define their needs, and share early design ideas with stakeholders. Close-up storyboards are often used to ideate specific design solutions and plan product details for prototypes.

Sitemaps
While user flow diagrams and storyboards help you map the sequence of users’ experiences, sitemaps show an overview of your product’s entire information architecture. A product’s information architecture includes:

Organization: how different pieces of information are grouped together

Hierarchy: how smaller pieces of information nest inside larger pieces

Sequence: how different pieces of information connect in order

When diagramed together, these three elements typically result in tree-like or root-like structures like the following. 

Empty sitemap template. One dark gray rectangle connects to 4 blue ones, which then connect to 2 or 3 light gray rectangles.
By providing an architecture for the entire product, sitemaps help designers identify the individual screens they need to design and plan how to connect those screens in their prototypes.

*Pro Tip* 

This guide has presented user flow diagrams, storyboards, and sitemaps in a specific order, but skilled designers don’t necessarily create these assets in a strict sequence. Instead, they iterate. For example, if you’re unsure where to place something in your sitemap, you might want to revisit the flow of user actions, screens, and decisions in your user flow diagrams. Similarly, if you update one of those user flow diagrams, you may want to validate that update by sketching it out in a close-up storyboard. As you iterate, just be sure that all your work focuses on addressing the user problems and goals you defined earlier.



Paper wireframes 
Once you have identified some of the key screens, actions, and decisions in your product’s user flow, you can start creating paper wireframes. Early in the prototyping phase, you should create multiple wireframes for each screen so you have different versions to compare and test.

To create a paper wireframe:

First, select the screen you want to design and identify its elements, including text, images, icons, and calls to action, like “submit” or “compose” buttons.

Second, draw a large rectangle on a piece of paper to represent the screen you’re designing. Ensure you can place the screen’s elements similar to how they will appear on the screen once it’s developed.

Third, draw industry-standard symbols to represent the screen’s elements:

Short labels and headings are written out

Longer pieces of body text are represented by horizontal lines 

Simple shapes, like menu icons, can be drawn as they appear

More complex visuals, such as images, photos, illustrations, and custom icons, are represented by squares with large Xs

Calls to action are represented by rectangles or circles, whichever fits the basic shape the element will have on the screen

Fourth, repeat this process multiple times for each screen. Ideally, you should end up with multiple versions of the same screen, like the following set of three wireframes:

Images of three wireframe sketches labeled A through C representing different layout options for a mobile app home page.
Fifth, compare your wireframes, identify areas where you can improve the user experience, and make refinements: Move, combine, remove, or redesign elements to better address user pain points and help users achieve their goals. 

As you continue to create and refine your paper wireframes, remember to take clear notes about key design decisions, like where you want to place elements in specific screens. 

*Pro Tip* 

Remember to save your original wireframes before redrawing them. Before-and-after examples of revised work are great to include in design portfolios!



Digital wireframes
After you have refined your paper wireframes, it’s time to convert them into digital wireframes. For example, consider the following paper wireframe and its digital equivalent:

Remember that digital wireframes should:

Be based on your paper wireframes, though you can make adjustments and refinements as needed 

Address the user needs, goals, and pain points you researched and defined in your empathize and define phases

Include more detail than your paper wireframes, such as the more detailed section headers and calls to action in the example above

Show a clear hierarchy of information for each screen by bringing key pieces of information or calls to action to the forefront

Indicate precisely what users will be able to do on each screen, such as review Your Previous Order and place a New Order in the example above

As you create your digital wireframes, remember these best practices:

Use your Figma account and create a new project file to house your wireframes. Then, upload pictures of your paper wireframes into the file so you can refer to them easily.

Create frames for each screen you’re designing. Make sure the frames resemble the screens of the device you’re designing for. Then, add grids to your frames to make it easy to align elements.

Use shapes, lines, and fills to create the elements of each screen, and use basic icons from free asset libraries to create buttons.

*Pro Tip*

Polished digital wireframes are great assets for getting approval from business stakeholders before you create hi-fi mockups. And in your design portfolios and job interviews, digital wireframes can show that you design in methodical stages rather than skipping important steps. So, remember to save your digital wireframes as you create them!



Low-fidelity prototypes
In a low-fidelity (or lo-fi) prototype, you will connect your digital wireframes together so users can simulate your product’s basic flow and functionality. You can create paper prototypes by organizing your paper wireframes in the right order, experimenting and refining as needed. The following review covers how to create lo-fi digital prototypes in Figma:

First, reflect on how users will likely interact with the product and expect to move through its key screens and calls to action. Refer to any user flow diagrams, close-up storyboards, and sitemaps you created earlier. If you haven’t yet created these assets to map users’ experiences with the product, take time to do so now. 

Second, rename your digital wireframes in Figma so they are clearly labeled with the appropriate screen types or screen names. For example, the wireframe for your product’s home screen should be labeled “Home screen” or something similar to make it easily identifiable.

Third, switch from the Figma Design tab to the Prototype tab. While the Design tab enables you to edit your wireframes, the Prototype tab makes it easier to connect wireframes into a prototype.

Fourth, connect your digital wireframes to show how users will interact with your product’s calls to action and move through its screens. The following is a quick refresher on how to connect elements in Figma:

Choose an element you want to make interactive, such as a call-to-action button.

Identify where you want that element to take users when they select it. You’ve identified the two elements you want to connect.

Hover over the first element with your cursor. A small circle with a plus sign should appear. This circle is a node you can connect to another element.

Hover over the node and a small arrow should appear. Click on the arrow, drag it to the second element you identified, and then release it. The two elements are now connected.

Repeat Steps 1–4 for all the connections you want to make between your wireframes. Pause periodically to reflect on your connections, compare them to your earlier work (such as your user flow diagrams), and make refinements to ensure the product’s flow meets users’ needs and goals. Then, your first lo-fi prototype is complete.

Remember that your designs can—and should—change over time, so it’s totally normal if you’re not sure about the best way to connect elements in your wireframes. With lo-fi prototypes, the important thing is to create a general outline of the product’s main user flow so you can share it with stakeholders and test it with users. At this stage, don’t worry about trying to prototype every specific connection that users may experience in the final product.

*Pro Tip* 

Just as user flow diagrams and sitemaps help you build lo-fi prototypes, so too will building prototypes help you refine your user flow diagrams and sitemaps. If the prototyping process reveals a change you should make to your product’s overall user flow or information architecture, note that change to implement later or take time to implement it right away.



A final checklist
Before you move on to test your lo-fi prototype, pause to ensure it’s ready. If there are fundamental problems with the overall flow or specific connections, your tests won’t be as useful as they could be. Make sure to:

Review your work from the empathize and define phases to ensure your wireframes and prototype address key user needs, problems, and goals

Create user flow diagrams, storyboards, and sitemaps to plan your product’s user flow and information architecture

Design paper and digital wireframes for each of the key screens you want to include in your lo-fi prototype, using industry-standard symbols to showcase key elements

Connect elements in your digital wireframes so users can simulate what will happen when they interact with key screens, calls to action, and other interactive features

Compare your wireframe connections to your user flow diagrams, storyboards, and sitemaps, making updates and refinements as needed

Once these activities are complete, you’ll ideally have a working lo-fi prototype you can share with business stakeholders and users to get feedback. Be sure to save your prototype as well as your paper and digital wireframes so you can draw on them for examples of your design work in your portfolios.
