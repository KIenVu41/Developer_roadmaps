You may have used the portfolio project guide as you completed the third and final portfolio project for the certificate. Or you may have used it as a guide for a design project on the job. Either way, be proud of your work, and think of ways it can continue to help you grow and develop!


Remember that the best UX designers seek continuous improvement. They routinely reflect on their work to identify strengths and areas for improvement. If you haven’t already, think back on your most recent design process and consider: 

What about my design work do I want to carry into future projects? 

Where do I want to adjust my approach or improve my skills?

How can I draw on this project to showcase my learning and skills in job applications?

The final part of the certificate is all about building your professional brand and preparing for UX design jobs. As you prepare, consider your most recent design project as a resource for showcasing your skills and brand as a UX designer. Ask yourself these questions:

Are there mockups or other design assets I want to include in my portfolio? Consider adding them soon, while the project is fresh in your mind.

Do I want to create a new case study from my most recent project? Get started by accessing the case study template in the Appendix below. 

Whether you’ve already got the UX design job of your dreams or you don’t plan to apply for UX design jobs yet, it’s never a bad time to update your design portfolio or start building a new case study. The best UX designers typically keep their portfolios and case studies as up-to-date as possible. This way, they’ll be ready to go when you need them!

You’re a UX designer, and your portfolio and case studies are powerful places to show your empathy, your process, and your skills. Be proud of your work and show it off!
