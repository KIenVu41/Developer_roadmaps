As you work on your final portfolio project or any UX design project, remember that effective UX design is all about iterating through the design thinking process: empathizing with users, defining their needs, and then ideating, prototyping, and testing possible solutions. 

Empathizing is a crucial first step—and a vital element throughout the whole process—because it enables designers to connect with users and deeply understand their pain points and goals. This kind of deep understanding will help you create products that will be meaningful and engaging for users in the long term. It will also help you build a design portfolio that will resonate with potential employers!

Process flow of design thinking framework: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. Test is highlighted.
When empathizing with users for a new design project, you should use:

User interviews

Empathy maps

User personas

User stories

User journey maps

In addition to creating the foundation for a user-centered design process, all these empathy activities will bolster your design portfolio as well. You can include elements of them in your portfolio website and in your case study presentations about specific design projects.

The following is a brief guide for completing each activity. Use it as a reference for your Capstone project or any design project. For a deeper review of each activity, including examples, return to Course 2 in the certificate.

*Pro Tip* 

Before you start to empathize with users, remember to consult any business requirements associated with your project, including any goals or parameters you received from your client or other business stakeholders. Then, conduct your empathy work in ways that align with those goals and parameters. For example, if the business requirements stipulate a time frame for the project, you’ll want to schedule and conduct your user interviews in a way that fits that larger time frame.



User interviews
In UX design, one of the main goals of empathizing is to determine who your users are, what their goals and needs are, and how they experience your product (or similar products). To get this information, you’ll need to:

Recruit interview participants who represent your target users

Plan your interviews and write effective interview questions

Conduct interviews to get usable information and build rapport with participants

The following is a brief refresher on key best practices for each phase of the interview process.

Recruit interview participants
Aim to recruit interview participants who represent—as fully as possible—the larger groups of users you’re designing for. This representative sample should include users who have been underrepresented in previous research due to their age, race, gender, or ability. 

To achieve a representative sample, identify your target users, divide them into smaller groups based on key similarities, and then aim to recruit four to six interview participants from each user group (or more). Remember that you can also use screener surveys to identify participants who will create a representative sample.

Finally, reach out to potential participants in ways that best suit your project and situation. Depending on the circumstances, you might recruit interview participants from a variety of places.

While some sources may be easier and faster to recruit from, they may not provide a representative sample. Try to achieve the most representative sample possible while still working within your project’s business requirements.

*Pro Tip* 

UX design employers typically value designers who can create great designs while also honoring key business requirements, like timeline and budget. If you’re working on your Capstone project, you don’t have business requirements to work with, but that doesn’t mean you aren’t working within parameters. Consider identifying what your parameters are: 

How much time do you have to complete the project? 

How frequently can you work on it? 

What other commitments are competing for your time and attention? 

Then, consider tracking how you work within those parameters. This way, you can tell potential employers how you achieve design goals within different kinds of constraints. 

Plan interviews
Aim to conduct interviews that create rapport with participants and get you the information you need to better understand your users. The following are general guidelines for planning interviews.

Select the interview venue or format. UX design interviews take many formats, but the most common are:

Questionnaires/surveys

In-person interviews

Phone interviews

Video interviews

Choose the venue or format that works best for your research goals and your project’s business requirements, including parameters like timeline and budget.

Write interview questions that align with your research goals and target the information you need. Remember that effective interview questions are open-ended, conversational, clear, and neutral: They should invite sharing and follow-up from participants and be phrased in plain language that doesn’t lead participants to specific responses. 

Prepare your materials and practice how you’ll conduct interviews. Gather your supplies, test any technology you’re using, research your participants so you can build rapport with them, and practice in front of a mirror or with someone you trust. 

*Pro Tip* 

Interviews can be costly and time-consuming to conduct, so careful planning is usually essential for working within a project’s business requirements. In particular, it’s vital to clarify your research goals and craft interview questions that target the kinds of information you need. Potential employers will likely value designers who can demonstrate this kind of forethought.

Conduct interviews
Effective interviews help you meet your research goals and also build goodwill with participants. To achieve these two goals, use the following best practices.

Thank the person for participating and try to build rapport: Greet the person in a friendly way, make light conversation, make eye contact, and so on

Record the interview if the participant allows so you can revisit it later, recall parts you don’t remember, and take additional notes

Make sure you have all the basic participant details that are relevant to the interview, such as the participant’s name and relevant demographic characteristics 

Follow interview etiquette by showing active listening (even when you’re taking notes), speaking clearly and concisely, and staying composed

Take thorough notes about what participants say and do. Try to capture compelling quotes and document participants’ expressions, body language, and behavior

*Pro Tip* 

Interviews are a great opportunity to practice interacting with users and building those interpersonal skills that many UX design employers value. After conducting interviews and recording your notes, consider pausing to reflect on your performance as an interviewer. You can identify strengths, note areas for improvement, and brainstorm answers to potential interview questions about your approach to conducting interviews or interacting with users.



Empathy maps
Once you’ve conducted interviews, you can use empathy maps to break down each interview into five digestible pieces of information:

Who exactly are the users and what are their situations?

What do users say about their experiences with the product or similar products?

What do users think about their experiences?

What do users do before, during, and after their experiences?

What do users feel about their experiences?

Remember that designers often organize these pieces of information in charts like the following:

Empathy maps are a crucial tool for processing the results of your interviews and distilling large amounts of information into more manageable pieces. They will help you create user personas to guide the next phases of your design thinking process.

*Pro Tip* 

Empathy maps make useful additions to design portfolios because they demonstrate your ability to empathize with users and organize large amounts of user information. For the same reasons, they’re also a good topic to discuss during UX design job interviews. Many potential employers will be eager to hear details about your approaches to different design tasks. So if it’s relevant to an employer’s question, don’t hesitate to give some specific examples of how you’ve parsed user interviews into the empathy map’s four categories (says, thinks, does, feels).



User personas
Once you’ve conducted interviews and processed the responses, you’re ready to distill your user groups into personas. Personas are fictional users who represent the needs, goals, and characteristics of larger groups. They will help you remember and design for your users without having to recall every detail you captured during your interviews. They will also help you create compelling stories to explain your design choices to clients and other stakeholders.

A typical user persona should include the following elements:

An image that represents the persona

The persona’s name and demographic details, including age, education, hometown, family, and occupation

A relevant personal quote that captures the persona’s attitude and personality

The persona’s goals, or the objectives they want to successfully complete

The persona’s frustrations, or the issues or pain points they encounter or try to avoid

A brief story or scenario that conveys the persona’s journey

The following is a template you can use to bring these elements together:

User persona templateUser persona template, including spaces for persona image, name, demographic details, personal quote, goals, frustrations, and story.
Remember that effective personas are firmly grounded in research. Each persona’s characteristics, goals, and frustrations should represent that persona’s larger user group and reflect the themes you noticed in that group’s interviews. When you base your personas in research, you reduce the risk that personal biases or unfounded assumptions will interfere with your designs.

*Pro Tip* 

Because they stand in for larger groups of real users, personas can powerfully shape your design choices. That’s why it’s vital for them to be grounded in objective research rather than assumptions. During design presentations or job interviews, don’t be surprised if business stakeholders or potential employers ask you to justify the choices behind your user personas. If they do, you’ll need to show how your personas emerged out of your user research.



User stories
A user story is a key part of a user persona. Told from a persona’s point of view, it introduces the user, lays out an obstacle, and states the user’s ultimate goal and reasons for that goal. Designers and design teams use these stories to identify and prioritize the key user goals and frustrations that will shape their designs.

For each user persona you create, write a brief sentence that establishes the following details about who, what, and why:

Who: The type of user that the persona represents, including their key characteristics

What: The action the persona hopes will happen, including any relevant pain points they want to avoid

Why: The benefit the persona wants to achieve from that action, which can be tangible or intangible

You can organize these who, what, and why details into one sentence with the following template.

As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

User journey maps
A user journey map is the series of experiences the user has as they try to achieve their goal. When done effectively, these maps showcase key pain points and areas for improvement that designers can address in their designs.

In the initial empathize phase of the design thinking process, you’ll want to create a user journey map for each of your personas. Each map should show the general experiences that users have as they try to achieve their goals, including any pain points they try to avoid. 

You may not yet have the data you need to map out specific actions that users take to engage with your product, and that’s OK. Instead, you can map users’ experiences based on the responses you got from interview participants. You can also imagine how real users might engage with the product or similar products. 

Remember that a typical user journey map has six main components. The first three are as follows:

Name: The user persona’s name

Goal: The user persona’s goal

Actions: The actions the persona takes to achieve their goal

For each action the persona takes, the journey map should also include:

Tasks: The specific tasks involved in the action

Feelings: The emotions the persona feels as they complete the tasks

Improvement opportunities: The areas for improving the user’s experience

When arranged together, these elements yield a table like the following. The table is titled with the persona’s name and goal. Each of the table’s columns focuses on a different action. In the column’s top row, there is a space to identify the action. In each subsequent row, there are spaces to list or describe the tasks, feelings, and improvement opportunities associated with the action.

As you create each journey map, remember to consider accessibility and check for bias in your assumptions and ideas. Think about the range of users with disabilities. Select at least one user group with disabilities, such as people with visual or hearing impairments, and identify any opportunities to make your design more accessible. Accessibility improvements often enhance a product for all users, so empathizing with users with disabilities is crucial for effective design.

A final checklist
Before you move on to the next phase of the design thinking process, pause to make sure you’ve completed all the key empathy activities for the first phase of your design project. Ask yourself whether you have:

Recruited a representative sample of interview participants

Planned interview questions that are relevant, open-ended, clear, neutral, and conversational

Conducted interviews to gather key information and build rapport with participants

Distilled each interview into an empathy map

Divided users into user groups based on shared characteristics, goals, or needs

Created a user persona to represent each user group

Included a compelling one-sentence user story in each persona

Mapped out a user journey for each persona

Finally, take time to review your user stories, personas, and journey maps and ensure they are free of biases or assumptions. All should be firmly based on your interviews and any other forms of user research. 

Now you’re ready to start defining your users’ problems so you can identify specific goals for your designs!
