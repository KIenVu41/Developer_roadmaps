Planning Your Research

A UX research plan should include seven key elements: project background, research goals, research questions, key performance indicators (KPIs), methodology, participants, and the discussion guide or script.
Clearly define the project background, outlining the reasons behind conducting the research and the problem you aim to address.
Setting Research Goals and KPIs

Establish specific research goals that address the design problems you want to solve.
Identify KPIs to measure progress toward your research goals, ensuring they are quantifiable and relevant to your objectives.
