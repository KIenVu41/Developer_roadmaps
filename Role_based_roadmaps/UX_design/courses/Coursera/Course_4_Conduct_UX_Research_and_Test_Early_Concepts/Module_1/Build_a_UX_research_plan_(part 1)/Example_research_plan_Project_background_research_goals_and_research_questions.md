You’ve learned that a UX research study is a step-by-step discovery of a group of users and their needs. Research studies help designers understand users’ problems so they can solve them. Creating a plan for a UX research study will help you make sure you get successful research results. 

You’ve also explored the first three parts of a UX research plan: the project background and research goals, which are part of the plan’s introduction, and the research questions. When they’re well-crafted, these elements provide a strong base for building the rest of a research plan. The introduction and research questions typically help design teams:

Establish overarching research goals

Identify who’s affected by the design

Define the deliverables that the research should yield

Ensure the quality of the research data

Example introduction and research questions
This review will go through an example of a research plan’s project background, research goals, and research questions. Refer to this review when you write your own UX research study plans, and use the example for reference and comparison.

This example is part of a research plan to test the low-fidelity prototype for the CoffeeHouse app, which you explored in earlier course items. Before moving on to the example, you can review the 
CoffeeHouse business scenario
. If you don’t have a Google account, you can download the scenario directly from the attachment below.


Here are the introduction and research questions for the CoffeeHouse research plan:


Introduction
Title: Creating CoffeeHouse ordering app 

Author: Ali, UX researcher, ali@coffeehouse.design 

Stakeholders: CoffeeHouse customers, Gael Esparza: CTO, Linda Yamamoto: VP of design 

Date: 12-14-2020 

Project background: We’re creating a CoffeeHouse app to help people place and pick up multiple CoffeeHouse orders together at once, so they can skip in-store lines and the payment process is streamlined. Some patrons place orders for groups, and ordering individually takes too long. 

Research goals: Figure out if collaborative ordering in the app actually saves people time when placing group orders. 

Research questions
How long does it take for 4–5 people to make a collaborative group order? 

What can we learn from the steps users take to order as a group, versus on their own?



Now that you’ve reviewed the example, it’s time to assess how it works.

UX research study plan template
First, notice how the example follows the UX research study plan template. Templates help designers ensure their research plans are complete, readable, and visually appealing. These features are especially helpful when you have to align a team on a plan or get approval from stakeholders. 

The introduction
Next, notice that the plan’s introduction includes six key elements:

Title

Author

Stakeholders

Date

Project background

Research goals

Title, author, stakeholders, and date
For anyone who engages with the research plan, these four details are crucial reminders of the project’s purpose, stakeholders, and timeframe. In the example, notice how:

The title clearly indicates the focus and purpose of the study. The focus is the CoffeeHouse app. The purpose is creating the app and not, for example, updating or testing an existing app.

The author section includes the researcher’s name, title, and email address. This contact information makes communicating about the plan more efficient.

The stakeholders section indicates the people who are involved in the research and their roles. In this case, it’s the group targeted for testing and the company employees who oversee app changes and operations (including their names and titles).

The date indicates when the plan was last updated, not when it was first created. Always remember to update the date every time you edit a research plan so you (and any teammates) know whether the plan is current.

Project background and research goals
In the example, notice how the project background offers a brief explanation of why the CoffeeHouse app is being created and what is being tested with users. It’s not long and detailed, but rather efficient and precise. 

As the example shows, a project background should offer a brief explanation of why you’re doing the research. It gets the team aligned at the beginning of the study and shows you understand the reason for the research. Also, for people who can act on your research and recommendations, a well-crafted project background promotes confidence in the overall quality of your analysis and insights. 

Next, notice how the research goals indicate what the researchers want to learn from testing the CoffeeHouse app and how the research results might affect their design decisions. They want to know whether collaborative ordering saves time.

Research goals should clarify the specific ideas you want to learn from the research or the outcomes you want to achieve. As you craft research goals, think about questions like these: 

What design problems am I trying to solve for the user and/or the business? 

How will the results of the research impact our design decisions? 

The research questions
Finally, consider the example’s research questions. These research questions are not the interview questions that researchers will pose to study participants. Instead, they state at a high level what the UX research is trying to answer:

How long does it take for 4–5 people to make a collaborative group order? 

What can we learn from the steps users take to order as a group, versus on their own?

These questions are effective because they showcase these four features:

Actionable: Actionable means each question clearly indicates the kind of answer being sought. With actionable questions, researchers will know when they have or have not found an answer. With the second question, for example, researchers know they are seeking information about the steps users are taking to make orders individually and in a group.

Specific: Specific questions produce meaningful data. In the first question, for example, notice the specific detail that researchers seek: length of time for a collaborative order made by a group of 4–5 people.

Neutral: To be neutral, research questions should be phrased so that they don’t sound like you’re assuming a particular answer to the question. They shouldn’t show bias or lead toward predetermined answers. For example, imagine if the first question were rewritten this way: “Why does it take groups so long to place collaborative orders?” This question is biased and leading: It assumes that collaborative orders take a long time rather than neutrally seeking information about how long the orders take.

Methodological: Methodological means the questions indicate whether they must be answered through quantitative or qualitative methods. The first question seeks quantitative information about length of time, information that can be measured numerically. The second question seeks qualitative information about users’ experiences. It offers opportunities to learn users’ feelings and other insights that are hard to capture numerically.

Questions to assess your research plans
When you start a research plan for your work, consider comparing the example above to your own introduction and research questions. 

As you assess your work, here are some guiding questions you can use: 

Have you constructed a UX research study plan introduction that:

Has a title that represents the focus and purpose of the study?

Lists the name, title, and email address for the author of the plan?  

Identifies the study’s stakeholders, including any groups targeted for testing and people at the company whose work might be affected by the study? 

Has the date that the plan was last updated?

Includes a brief explanation of the project background that communicates both the reason for the study and the concept being tested?

Outlines research goals that demonstrate what you’d like to learn from the study and how your research results might affect your design decisions?

Based on your project’s problem statement, were you able to write research questions that are:

Actionable and clearly answerable by your research? 

Specific, to make sure your study produces meaningful data?

Neutrally phrased and not leading, so users aren’t guided toward providing certain answers?

Clear on whether quantitative or qualitative data is being collected?

If you’re reviewing your own work and can answer “yes” to each of these questions, terrific job! If there are questions you were unable to answer “yes” to, then these are areas where you can improve your UX research study plan and primary research questions. Go back and rewrite those elements with these criteria in mind.

Key takeaways
Beginning a UX research study plan is a crucial first step in understanding users’ problems in order to solve them. A well-crafted introduction demonstrates that you understand the reason for your UX research, and it promotes confidence in your analysis and insights. Strong research questions help you get meaningful data that can be used to improve the usability of your designs.
