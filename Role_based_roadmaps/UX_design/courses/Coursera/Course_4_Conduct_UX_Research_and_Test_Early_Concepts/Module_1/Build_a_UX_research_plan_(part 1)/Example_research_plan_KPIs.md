You’ve learned that key performance indicators, or KPIs, help you determine what is working well and what needs improvement in your UX research design. This feedback helps designers decide how to move forward with their design. 

You’ve also learned that KPIs are situational: Some KPIs measure “bad” things, while others measure “good” things. So, what you use will depend on the information you want to get. It’s important to choose the ones that will best help you to evaluate your research goals. The more your KPIs inform your research goals, the more you’ll be able to design for your end user. Ultimately, KPIs are an accountability tool to evaluate whether you’re addressing the problem you set out to solve in the first place! 

Example research plan with KPIs
This review will go through an example of a research plan’s KPIs. Refer to this review when you write your own UX research study plans, and use the example for reference and comparison.

This example is part of a research plan to test the low-fidelity prototype for the CoffeeHouse app, which you explored in earlier course items. Before moving on to the example, you can review the 
CoffeeHouse business scenario
. If you don’t have a Google account, you can download the scenario directly from the attachment below.


Here is the CoffeeHouse research plan, complete with the key performance indicators.


Introduction
Title: Creating CoffeeHouse ordering app 

Author: Ali, UX researcher, ali@coffeehouse.design 

Stakeholders: CoffeeHouse customers, Gael Esparza: CTO, Linda Yamamoto: VP of Design 

Date: 12-14-2020 

Project background: We’re creating a CoffeeHouse app to help people place and pick up multiple CoffeeHouse orders together at once, so customers can skip in-store lines and the business can streamline the payment process. Some patrons place orders for groups, and ordering individually takes too long. 

Research goals: Figure out if collaborative ordering in the app actually saves people time when placing group orders. 

Research questions
How long does it take for 4–5 people to make a collaborative group order? 

What can we learn from the steps users take to order as a group, versus on their own?

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Time on task

User error rates

Conversion rates



Now that you’ve reviewed the example, it’s time to assess how it works.

The KPIs 
In the example, notice how the UX research study plan clearly identifies three KPIs that are relevant to the project’s research goals:

Time on task: How long it takes a user to complete a task

User error rates: How often users make mistakes 

Conversion rates: The number of users who reach their goal successfully

Each of the selected KPIs will be used to measure user feedback. 

The time on task KPI provides insight into whether the app speeds up group ordering or not by showing how long it takes users to make an individual order and a group order.

User error rates will indicate how often users get lost or make mistakes while making an order. The feedback will identify common sticking points in the design and places where improvement is needed.

The conversion rate KPI will provide feedback on whether the current checkout process is effective by showing how many users successfully complete their group orders.

Remember, these KPIs can be looked at by themselves or combined with other KPIs. The more you find overlapping feedback between KPIs, the more you can identify different insights. For example, if time on task is high, user error rates are high, and conversion rates are low, that is a sign that the current process for group orders is difficult and inefficient for users, causing them to feel frustrated and stop using the product altogether. This kind of feedback is valuable for assessing how well your current design meets the project goal. 

Questions to assess your research plans
Consider comparing the example provided above to your own KPI selection. 

As you assess your work, here are some guiding questions you can use:

Have you chosen KPIs that:

Measure progress toward a research goal?

Reveal meaningful insights into user behavior? 

Provide actionable feedback about how the design is performing?

If you’re reviewing your own work and can answer “yes” to each of these questions, terrific job! If there are questions you were unable to answer “yes” to, then these are areas where you can refine your KPI selection process. Go back and choose new KPIs with the three questions above in mind. 

Key takeaways
Choosing KPIs that accurately evaluate your project’s goals leads to a more complete and usable product. The more you know about your users, the more you can design with them in mind! The way you approach your product isn’t always the way users will. Using KPIs to learn how users interact with your product will improve your skills as a researcher and designer. The more you take feedback into consideration, the better your designs will become!
