Research is a vital part of the UX design process—in every phase, from start to finish. In this reading, the focus is on research in the test phase. You’ll learn how research in this final phase differs from research in other phases, how it’s structured, and how it can benefit the design and end-user. To start, let’s put it into context.

Imagine this: The product you’ve been working on is finally ready to launch. You are very excited to complete the project. But, before you get too excited, an experienced UX designer comes in and asks what your research has indicated. Wait. What? 

Yes, that’s right. There’s more to do to ensure the product provides the best end-user experience. Let’s learn more.

Research in the test phase
When a product is ready to launch (or go live) it can—and should—be iterated upon. This means conducting research, in the form of user testing, to determine how users view and use the product. This type of testing is called acceptance testing and means that UX designers want to see how real-life users react to the UX design of the final product. Even at this final stage of the design process, the design can be adjusted and iterated based on the user testing feedback. In general, the changes should be minor refinements as more substantial changes and iterations should have been done during prototyping. To sum it up, the research during the testing phase helps UX designers refine the design to help give end-users the best possible experience.

Benefits of test phase research
During the UX design process, research should happen during each design phase. Once the design is transitioned into a prototype, user testing should occur. Prototype testing can help refine ideas and design, prior to finalizing the user interface. By conducting research and testing when the product is in a prototype form, the UX design team can save time by making changes prior to development. In addition, the UX design team can iterate the designs based on user feedback, which will ultimately lead to a better end-user experience once the product is launched. 

Types of test phase research 
The research conducted during the test phase encompasses all that the UX design team has learned in the earlier stages of the research process. By this time, all of the questions from the previous phases should be answered. Now, during the test phase, the goal is to ensure the concept and design actually work. To do this, a UX designer may conduct various testing types, including:

User acceptance testing (UAT)
UAT determines if the product does what it was designed to do. 

Quality assurance testing (QA)
QA testing examines the product for any unwanted errors and tests if everything works as intended. If, during QA testing, the UX design team discovers something that doesn’t work as intended, such as a button that does not redirect to the correct page, they may submit a bug report to the development team so the issue can be fixed. 

Accessibility evaluation
Accessibility evaluation ensures that all aspects of the product adhere to the accessibility standards. This evaluation may be part of the QA testing. 

Research structure at the test phase
Research in the test phase should be carefully structured to ensure that the end product fully meets users’ needs. 

Test participants
To do this, UX designers should gather participants from the demographic that was defined as the target users. Services such as usertesting.com may be helpful to use as this type of service has testing subjects available in the platform. If not using a service, UX designers can recruit testing subjects directly. 

Test location
The user testing can take place in a lab where the test subjects can be observed, in-person, by the UX design team. With this, the UX design team can watch how the test subjects navigate the website or app. If a lab, or in-person, testing experience is not possible, UX designers can conduct the testing online and record the user actions for further review.  

Questionnaires
Questionnaires can also be used to gain user feedback. In the questionnaire, the test subjects may be asked to do specific tasks in the product. For example, if the product is an app that helps users select and purchase shoes, the questionnaire may include tasks and questions such as: 

Search for a leather shoe in your size. How was your experience searching for it?

Select the leather shoe and go through the checkout process, up to the point of payment. How did you like the checkout process? Is there anything you’d want to improve?

The questionnaire may also include general questions. These questions usually are presented after the test subjects have completed the specific task. General questions may include: 

How do you feel about the design of the app?

How do you feel navigating through the app?

How do you feel about the placement of the product on the app?

Did you find all the necessary information to make an informed decision about the product?

How would you improve the app?

What did you like/not like about the app?

Key takeaways
Research as part of the test phase is a critical element in the success of any product. UX designers can, and should, use research throughout the UX design process. The resulting data will help inform the design decisions and iterations that will help produce a product that meets the end-users’ needs.
