Participant Characteristics

Define the primary characteristics of your ideal participants based on your research goals, ensuring each characteristic ties back to your end-user.
For example, when designing a dog walking app, target dog owners with busy schedules who frequently engage in outdoor activities.
Importance of Diversity and Representation

Include participants with diverse perspectives and abilities, including those with disabilities, to gather comprehensive feedback and ensure your product is accessible to all potential users.
Avoid sample bias by ensuring your participant pool represents a wide range of users and not just a select group.
