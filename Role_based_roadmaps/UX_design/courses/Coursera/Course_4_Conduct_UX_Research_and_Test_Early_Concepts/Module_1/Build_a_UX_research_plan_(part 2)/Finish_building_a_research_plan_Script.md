Why Use a Script?

Using a script helps ensure you don't forget important questions and maintain consistency in the language used with each participant, leading to more reliable results.
It's crucial to avoid improvising questions during usability studies to maintain consistency and avoid introducing bias.
Tips for Writing Effective Interview Questions:

Ask open-ended questions (e.g., "How did you feel about...?") to encourage participants to provide detailed insights and avoid yes/no questions that limit responses.
Encourage elaboration by prompting participants to provide more details when they give brief answers, leading to richer data.
