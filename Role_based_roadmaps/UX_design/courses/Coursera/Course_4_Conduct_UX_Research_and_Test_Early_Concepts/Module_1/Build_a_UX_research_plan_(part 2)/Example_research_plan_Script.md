You’ve learned that a script, also referred to as a discussion guide, is a list of tasks and follow-up questions a researcher presents to participants in the interview portion of a usability study. Using a script in your research plan gives you a clear understanding of what a user is trying to do, how they think and feel, and what their problems are. Making a habit of writing scripts for your research plans will improve your ability to understand your users and identify solutions that address their needs. The tasks and follow-up questions in the script should be based on the research questions and KPIs you chose earlier in the study plan. 

Example research plan
This review will go through the script for the CoffeeHouse app usability study, which you explored in earlier course items. Refer to this review when you write your own UX research study plans, and use the example for reference and comparison. Before moving on to the example, you can review the 
CoffeeHouse business scenario
. If you don’t have a Google account, you can download the scenario directly from the attachment below.


Here is the CoffeeHouse research plan, complete with a script:


Introduction
Title: Creating CoffeeHouse ordering app 

Author: Ali, UX researcher, ali@coffeehouse.design 

Stakeholders: CoffeeHouse customers, Gael Esparza–CTO, Linda Yamamoto–VP of Design 

Date: 12-14-2020 

Project background: We’re creating a CoffeeHouse app to help people place and pick up multiple CoffeeHouse orders together at once, so they can skip in-store lines and the payment process is streamlined. Some patrons place orders for groups, and ordering individually takes too long. 

Research goals: Figure out if collaborative ordering in the app actually saves people time when placing group orders

Research questions
How long does it take for 4–5 people to make a collaborative group order? 

What can we learn from the steps users take to order as a group, versus on their own?

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Time on task

User error rates

Conversion rates

Methodology
Unmoderated usability study. 

Location: United States, remote (participants will go through the usability study in their own homes). 

Date: Sessions will take place on February 8 and 9.

Five participants complete the collaborative ordering tasks on their own. One of the participants is randomly chosen to submit the group order. Each participant completes a questionnaire on their experience privately. 

Each session will last 45 minutes, and will include an introduction, a list of tasks, and a short questionnaire. 

Participants
Participants are people who place group coffee orders at least twice a month, whether it’s a business task or a social task. The orders could be for office meetings, friend groups, or family. 

Participants don’t have to be coffee drinkers themselves. 

2 male, 2 female, 1 non-binary, all aged 20–75 years old.

 1 user of assistive technologies (keyboard, screen reader).  

Incentive: $10 CoffeeHouse gift card redeemable at any location or online.

Script
Intro: 

 Before we begin, do I have your consent to take both audio and video recordings of this interview?   

 I want you to know that this isn’t a test. There is no “right” answer, and none of your responses will be considered wrong.  

 If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.   

 This data is being collected to help create an app that makes ordering coffee easier. Your answers will help us make the app easier for people to use.

 Basic questions:  

 Do you live in an area with lots of coffee shops?   

 Do you have a favorite coffee shop?   

 How many times a week do you order coffee from a store?   

 Do you usually order for yourself, or for a group?   

 Can you talk me through a normal day in your life?   

 Great! If you’re ready, let’s move on to the tasks you’ll be working on.   

Prompt 1: Open up the CoffeeHouse app on your phone and customize a drink order for yourself. Do your best to talk me through your thought process. 

 Prompt 1 follow-up: How easy do you feel it is to customize a drink the way you like it? What was easy and what was challenging?   

Prompt 2: If I said, “start a new group order,” would you know what to do? 

 Prompt 2 follow-up: Try it out now, please.  

 Prompt 2 follow-up: Did you find anything confusing?   

Prompt 3: From the existing group order screen, add your custom drink from a moment ago, then add multiple other custom drinks to the same order and proceed to the checkout screen. 

 Prompt three follow-up: How do you feel about the process of purchasing multiple drinks in the same order? What was easy and what was challenging?   

Prompt 4: Finally, check out and complete the group order. 

 Prompt 4 follow-up: How do you feel about paying for different orders in the same transaction? What are your feelings about the amount of time it took to complete?   

Prompt 5: How do you feel about the CoffeeHouse app overall? What did you like and dislike about it?



Now that you’ve reviewed the example, it’s time to assess how it works.

The script
First, notice how the script starts with an introduction. This introduction: 

Asks for the participant’s consent to record the interview

Informs the participant that the interview is not a test, and that no answer is wrong

Assures the participant that it’s okay to ask questions

Explains why the participant’s data is being collected

Asks for basic information about the participant’s relationship with the product 

Together, these elements of the introduction will help the researcher achieve three important objectives:

Gather important demographic data about the participant.

Set a professional tone for the interview.

Help participants feel comfortable during the interview.

Second, consider how the researcher has created a series of prompts and follow-up questions. These prompts and questions will help the researcher investigate the KPIs they chose earlier in their research plan. Each prompt outlines a task for participants to complete, so the researcher can record how each participant responds. After these tasks are complete, the prompt’s follow-up questions will help the researcher learn what the participant’s experience was like. 

Finally, consider the content, style, and tone of the prompts and follow-up questions. They are:

Open-ended: Encourage action, discussion, reflection rather than short “yes or no” responses.

Objective: Avoid giving clues about how to complete a task, leading participants toward particular answers, and revealing the researchers’ biases.

Goal oriented: Relate directly to the research plan’s KPIs and research goals.

When prompts and follow-ups meet these criteria, they help researchers gather rich information that leads to actionable insights about users’ experience. Actionable insights are key for iterating and improving designs, both in your portfolio project usability study and in professional design projects.

Questions to assess your research plans
When you create research plans (either in your portfolio project or on the job), consider using the example for reference and comparison. Ask yourself whether your UX research study plan script:

Starts with an introduction that gathers demographic data and sets the right tone

Contains prompts and follow-up questions that can be read the same way to all participants

Encourages open-ended action, discussion, and reflection

Remains objective and avoids leading participants or introducing bias

Directly addresses your research plan’s KPIs and research goals 

If you can answer “yes” to each of these questions, well done! If there are questions to which you were unable to answer “yes,” then these are areas in which you can improve your script writing skills for UX research study plans. Think of this as an opportunity to build a great process for approaching interviews. Consider going back and reexamining your script with these four criteria in mind.

Key takeaways
Writing a well-rounded script is an important step in a research study plan. Thoughtful questions and appropriate tasks will help you gain actionable insights into your user’s needs, behaviors, and motivations. Without the script, the next steps of your design process may be based on guesswork rather than data.
