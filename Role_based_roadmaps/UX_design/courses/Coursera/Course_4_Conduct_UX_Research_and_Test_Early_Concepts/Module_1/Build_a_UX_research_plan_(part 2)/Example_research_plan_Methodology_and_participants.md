You’ve learned that a methodology is the steps you take to conduct your research. Including a methodology in your plan will help to inform your stakeholders of what will happen during the study, how long the study will be, and where it will take place. The methodology will give stakeholders more confidence in your study’s results because they can see all of the steps involved, and they’ll be more likely to act on your suggestions. A methodology section also provides the details other researchers need to repeat the exact same study in the future, so it can be repeated for similar results to verify that the study is reliable. 

A solid methodology will list: 

The procedures you’ll use while collecting the information you need to answer your research questions 

The time and location of product tests and interviews

Who will conduct the tests

How the tests will be conducted

Additionally, the goal of a usability study is to collect honest feedback from users, so gathering feedback from people with diverse perspectives and abilities is crucial. The participants section of your UX research study plan should include:

The primary characteristics of people you’ll recruit to participate

An incentive for people to participate

A means to thank them for their participation

Example research plan with methodology and participants
This review will go through an example of a research plan’s methodology and participants. Refer to this review when you write your own UX research study plans, and use the example for reference and comparison.

This example is part of a plan to test the low-fidelity prototype for the CoffeeHouse app, which you explored in earlier course items. Before moving on to the example, you can review the 
CoffeeHouse business scenario
. If you don’t have a Google account, you can download the scenario directly from the attachment below.


Here is the CoffeeHouse research plan, complete with the methodology and participants. 


Introduction
Title: Creating CoffeeHouse ordering app 

Author: Ali, UX researcher, ali@coffeehouse.design 

Stakeholders: CoffeeHouse customers, Gael Esparza: CTO, Linda Yamamoto: VP of design 

Date: 12-14-2020 

Project background: We’re creating a CoffeeHouse app to help people place and pick up multiple CoffeeHouse orders together at once, so they can skip in-store lines and the payment process is streamlined. Some patrons place orders for groups, and ordering individually takes too long. 

Research goals: Figure out if collaborative ordering in the app actually saves people time when placing group orders. 

Research questions
How long does it take for 4–5 people to make a collaborative group order? 

What can we learn from the steps users take to order as a group, versus on their own?

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Time on task

User error rates

Conversion rates

Methodology
Unmoderated usability study. 

Location: United States, remote (participants will go through the usability study in their own homes). 

Date: Sessions will take place on February 8 and 9.

Five participants complete the collaborative ordering tasks on their own. One of the participants is randomly chosen to submit the group order. Each participant completes a questionnaire on their experience privately. 

Each session will last 45 minutes and will include an introduction, a list of tasks, and a short questionnaire. 

Participants
Participants are people who place group coffee orders at least twice a month, whether as a business task or a social task. These orders could be for office meetings, friend groups, or family gatherings. 

Participants don’t have to be coffee drinkers themselves

2 male, 2 female, 1 non-binary, all aged 20–75 years old

1 user of assistive technologies (keyboard, screen reader)

Incentive: $10 CoffeeHouse gift card redeemable at any location or online




Now that you’ve reviewed the example, it’s time to assess how it works.

The methodology section
Consider how the example lists the information pertinent to the methodology section of the research plan, including:

The type of study, like an unmoderated usability study, which means participants go through the instructions, tasks, and questions on their own without a moderator.

The location of the study, like the United States (remote), which means U.S. participants will go through the usability study in their own homes.

The specific dates when the study will take place. As shown in the example, sessions will take place on February 8 and 9. 

The number of participants included in the study. For example, five participants are responsible for completing the collaborative ordering tasks on their own; one of the participants is randomly chosen to submit the group order; and each participant is responsible for completing a questionnaire on their experience privately. 

A short description of the study session. As shown in the example, each session will last 45 minutes and will include an introduction, a list of tasks, and a short questionnaire.

The more descriptive you are, the easier it will be for stakeholders to understand your research plan and for your study to be replicated in the future. Once you have your methodology figured out, you can move onto identifying and describing your study participants. 

The participants section
With the methodology information clearly defined, the participants' details can then be decided. As in the example, the participants section of a research plan should include:

The primary characteristics of ideal participants, like their age, gender, race, accessibility needs, and in the case of the example, coffee preferences

An incentive for people to participate, like a $10 CoffeeHouse gift card to any physical or online store.

A means to thank the participants for their time, like a short thank-you message

Questions to assess your research plans
Consider comparing the example provided above to your own methodology and participants section. 

As you assess your work, here are some guiding questions you can use. Have you constructed a UX research study plan methodology that:

Lists the procedures for conducting the usability test?

Lists the time and location the test will occur?  

Identifies who will be conducting the test and whether it's moderated or unmoderated? 

Describes the way the test will be conducted?

From your methodology, were you able to decide:

The primary characteristics that make your participants ideal for the test and ensure that you’re gathering feedback from people with diverse perspectives and abilities?

The incentive that makes participants want to be involved in the study and that thanks them for their time?

If you’re able to answer “yes” to each of these questions, fantastic work! If there are questions you were unable to answer “yes” to, then these are areas where you can improve your UX research study plan methodology and improve the participants as needed. Go back and rewrite those elements with these criteria in mind.

Key takeaways
Establishing how you’ll conduct your UX research study and who will participate in it are some of the final steps of creating your study plan. A detailed methodology in your plan will help stakeholders feel confident in the study’s results and in acting on those results with design decisions. A well-explained participants section will help you make sure a representative sample of users is being tested in your study, including users with diverse perspectives and abilities. This is important for getting honest, helpful feedback. And now that you have a plan for your UX research study, you and your team can review it for any needed changes to make each aspect of the study more effective.
