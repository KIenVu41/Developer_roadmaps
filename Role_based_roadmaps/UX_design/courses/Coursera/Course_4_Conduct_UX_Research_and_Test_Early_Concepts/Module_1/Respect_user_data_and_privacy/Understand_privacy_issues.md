Vulnerable Populations in UX Research

It's crucial to recognize that certain groups, like minors or individuals with disabilities, may require extra care due to their potential vulnerabilities in research settings.
Always consult with research ethics experts when dealing with potentially vulnerable groups to ensure you're following ethical guidelines and privacy laws.
Protecting Research Data

Maintaining data security involves three key aspects: accurate data recording aligned with UX research standards, secure data storage to prevent unauthorized access or damage, and appropriate data retention policies.
These practices not only ensure ethical research conduct but also protect both the researcher and their company from potential legal issues.
Tools for Maintaining Privacy in UX Research

De-identification techniques, such as using pseudonyms or generalizing participant descriptions, help protect participant identities when sharing research findings.
Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) offer legal protection against idea theft, which is particularly important when involving participants in testing new products or features before public release.
