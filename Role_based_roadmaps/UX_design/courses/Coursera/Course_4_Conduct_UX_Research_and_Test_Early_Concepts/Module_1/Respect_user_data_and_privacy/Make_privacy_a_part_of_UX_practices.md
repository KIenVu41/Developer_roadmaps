Why Privacy Matters

Ethical Responsibility: Protecting user data is fundamental to ethical research, demonstrating integrity and respect for participants.
Legal Compliance: Privacy laws, like those in the US and other regions, mandate the protection of user information.
Types of Data to Safeguard

Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Specific details that can directly identify a user, such as names, addresses, and contact information.
Sensitive PII (SPII): Highly sensitive data that could lead to harm, embarrassment, or discrimination if compromised, including social security numbers, financial details, and health information.
Designing for Privacy

Transparency: Clearly inform users about what data is collected and how it will be used.
Data Minimization: Only collect data essential to the research study, avoiding unnecessary information gathering.
