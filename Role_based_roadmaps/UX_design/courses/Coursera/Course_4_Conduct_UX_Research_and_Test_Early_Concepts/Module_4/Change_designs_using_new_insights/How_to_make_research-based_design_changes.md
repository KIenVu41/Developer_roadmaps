Wireframe Iteration

Design changes are made to wireframes, not directly on the low-fidelity prototype, similar to how an author edits the content of a book before binding it.
Three insights from a usability study on a dog walker app are used to iterate on the wireframes: enabling recurring bookings, simplifying date picking, and adding a confirmation page.
Design Changes Based on Insights

A "Recurring Booking" checkbox is added to allow users to schedule walks on the same day and time weekly.
The date and time selection is improved with a scrollable list of dates and times, replacing the open text box, and adding the option to specify walk duration.
A "Confirm Booking" screen is added to the wireframes to address user feedback requesting a confirmation step before finalizing the booking.
