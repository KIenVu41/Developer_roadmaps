Prioritizing Research Insights

After conducting a usability study, prioritize identified pain points, starting with the most critical ones labeled as Priority 0 (P0), which need immediate fixing for the product to function correctly.
Other insights can be categorized as Priority 1 (P1) or Priority 2 (P2) based on their urgency and impact on user experience.
