You’ve learned about 
organizing insights
 and 
sharing those insights
. Remember that research insights are grounded in real data, answer the research questions, should be easy to understand, increase empathy for the user’s experience, and inspire direct action. You also learned about 
presenting your insights
. Presentations are a great way to share your research insights with people in your organization and with external parties. Presentations allow you to display your findings in an organized and detailed manner that is easy for the audience to follow and understand. In addition, they give you an opportunity to showcase all the hard work you put into your research study.

Now, you will review how a designer created and delivered a presentation for the Dog Walking app.


Part 1: The slide presentation
Presentations are a great way to share your insights and recommendations with other people in your organization. Giving a presentation is similar to telling a story. The information on each slide advances the story you are telling about your research and should include a beginning, middle, and conclusion. Keep in mind that best practice is to share your presentation digitally for your audience to review either before or after you present. Your presentation should be informative, usable, and engaging whether it’s being delivered in-person or reviewed digitally. 

To give you an example, let’s review the slide presentation of the research gathered for the Dog Walking app. 

The template
A template can be a great way to get started on a slide presentation and is a simple framework for how to do a presentation. Feel free to use the template below as you create your own presentation. The colors can be changed and Google slide themes can be added to give your presentation a different look. 

The template the designer used for the Dog Walking app can be accessed by selecting the link below and then selecting USE TEMPLATE.

Introduction slides
The introduction of the presentation tends to cover the presentation topic, the presentation’s contributors, and the table of contents. In this example, the first slide includes the presentation title, date, and names of team members who helped create it. If you’re not sure what to title your own presentation, it’s okay to start with something simple, like the following example, “Dog-Walking App Usability Study”:

The first presentation slide, which includes the title, date, and team members who helped create the presentation.
Most presentations of this kind include a table of contents. This is a one-slide list that will give the audience a high-level overview of what to expect during the slide presentation. Here's an example:

Table of Contents slide: Section 1: Study Details; Section 2: Themes; Section 3:  Insights and Recommendations
 The project background slide
Next, the designer focused on the project background slide. The project background slide is based on the design project research plan, and it explains what led the designer to conduct this research. Remember, a research plan helps you plan your products and achieve actionable results. It includes the project’s background, research goals, detailed research questions, KPIs, methodology, participants, and a script of questions to ask participants. The project background also covers why the insights were needed and what impact they’ll have on decisions being made. In short, the project background is a high-level overview that explains why the designer did this project and what its purpose is. The designer scripted an effective background statement because it explains what led the designer to conduct the research.  Here is the example: 

Project background slide with an explanation of why the app was created.Project background slide: “We’re creating a new app to help people find and schedule dog walkers. We need to find out if the main user experience, finding and scheduling a dog walker, is easy for users to complete.”
Study detail slides
The content for the study detail slides should come from the research plan. These slides should include information about the study that was conducted, including what was done in order to answer the research questions. The main purpose of this section is to concisely summarize the following information:

Research questions.

Demographic information about the participants. This could be age, gender expression, users with impairments, region, and more. Include anything that may be relevant to the project background.

An example of the designs; for example, a screenshot of the product or feature about which participants provided feedback.

Numeric data with defined metrics. This data is important because it lends credibility to the study.

Here’s an example of a study details slide:

Study details slide with three categories: Research Questions, Participants, and Methodology.Research Questions: How long does it take a user to find and book a dog walker in the app?; What can we learn from the user flow, or the steps that users take, to book a dog walker?; Participants: 5 participants between the ages of 20–60; 2 males, 2 females, and 1 non-binary individual; Methodology: 10 minutes per participant; United States, remote, unmoderated usability study, users were asked to perform tasks in a low-fidelity prototype.
And here’s an example of a prototype image slide:

Prototype/Designs Tested slide showing a screenshot of the dog walking app prototype on a mobile phone.
If images are in your presentation, it’s also important to add alt text descriptions so the images are accessible when stakeholders review the presentation on their own. Alt text is the text that explains an image when that image can’t be viewed. It’s essential for accessibility so screen readers can deliver the alt text to a person who is visually impaired.

This is how to add alt text to an image in Google Slides:

Right-click on the image.

Select Alt text from the menu.

Enter a title and description for the image.

Click OK.

Research themes 
The next part of the presentation is highlighting research themes. This is where the designer presents the synthesis of their data and summarizes their study’s key trends. In addition, research themes inform the research plan and project background and are organized by trends in the research results. It is best to commit one slide to each theme. List the theme at the top as the header, and provide evidence to support that theme in bullets below.

One particularly impactful part of the research themes slides would be to add quotes from participants that support the theme. A quote helps bring the theme to life in the words of someone experiencing the product firsthand. The designer also added screenshots of the prototypes or products with which test users had issues in order to highlight the problem(s). Here’s an example of a research theme slide:

Research themes slide: data synopsis and user quote on the left, and a screenshot of the app on a mobile device on the right. Left side showing a synopsis of the data: Most participants want to book a dog walker on a regular basis; 4 of the 5 participants want to be able to book a dog walker repeatedly; not all participants who want to book a dog walker on a regular basis expressed the same level of frustration. A user quote from Participant A reads: “I also would have liked a way to book a dog walker every Saturday morning. It seems like you can only book one appointment at a time for this. That’s kind of annoying too.” Right side showing a screenshot of the dog walking app prototype.
The insights
Next, the designer focused on the presentation slides for the insights. The template provides a slide for the insights the designer gained in their study. Notice that each circle is populated with a different insight. In a well-conducted study, there should be three to five strong insights that can be drawn from the data. This is an important place to be concise. The designer’s research insights should be phrased simply and effectively, and the section below (which explains them) should never be more than two sentences. This can also be a good place to put hyperlinks for more detailed information. Here’s an example:

Research insights slide.Insight 1: Unable to make a recurring booking. In general, users want to book a dog walker on a scheduled basis. Insight 2: Payment system is difficult. According to this study by Pew Research, users find it twice as difficult to resolve disputes and difficulties over mobile payments than other types, on all apps. Insights 3 and 4 are blank and can be completed as necessary.
Recommendations 
Recommendations to the stakeholders is the last part of the presentation. Recommendations are proposed actions the stakeholders should take based on the study, and they’re often based directly on insights. If insights highlight a problem, recommendations suggest the solution. This is also an important place to be concise—the recommendations should be simple to understand and easy to implement. It’s also another good place to hyperlink relevant information. Include at least three recommendations at the end of the presentation. Here’s what a simple recommendations slide might look like. At this point, the designers can take this opportunity to rank the recommendations from most important to least important.

Younger users prefer to do this by app—according to a study by Wakefield research, 69 percent of millennials use technology to keep track of and engage with their pets. Recommendations 2 and 3 are blank and can be completed as necessary.
Considerations
Once a designer has drafted a presentation of research results, they can use the following checklist to ensure their presentation is impactful: 

Ensure the presentation includes slides for each part of the presentation template, including:

A title slide  

A table of contents slide  

A project background slide  

Study details slides  

Theme slides  

An insights slide  

A recommendations slide  

Provide a high-level overview to orient your viewers.

Summarize key information.

Define metrics and numeric data for your study.

Link to examples of more detailed information.

Include visual examples and add alt text to all images.

Describe specific recommendations and next steps.

Add some personality! 

The template used is a basic response template. Feel free to experiment with Google slide themes, fonts, and data arrangements. 


Part 2: From planning to presenting
Now that you’ve learned about creating a slideshow presentation for your research insights, it’s time to learn about how to prepare and deliver the presentation. As a reminder, the five tips to consider when presenting are:

Be concise

Keep your tone conversational

Use stories

Don't be afraid to pause

Try to make eye contact

The presentation
Presenting isn’t something that designers are just suddenly good at. In fact, if designers closely examine the content and delivery of successful presenters, they’ll realize that there are several things that great presenters do that they can start doing too.

Let’s examine how the designer can make their research insights presentation great! For reference, this is the same template that was used earlier in the reading.

The notes section
Let’s examine the Research insights slide and focus on the Notes section. This section is where the designer would write notes for their presentation. The text will be visible during the presentation, but not for the audience. Notice how the “Click to add speaker notes” is highlighted. This is where the notes will go. The designer can expand the notes field by selecting the three-dot symbol, located between the slide and the notes section.

Next, notice how the notes section is populated. It has two to three main points, each on a new line, of key information that the designers will need to communicate in their presentation. 

Research insights slide with the notes section highlighted and two key insights noted in text.
Now, notice how the notes have evolved. The notes have turned into concise sentences that the designer would say to their audience. To make this transition, they would simply use the cursor to select the first main point and use it to create a sentence for what they will say to their audience. This action would be repeated for every main point in the speaker notes section. 

The designer doesn’t need to write everything they’re going to say in the presentation. That would make them sound robotic and rehearsed. Instead, each sentence will be a starting point for the main point they are discussing. Once they read the first sentence in the speaker notes section aloud to the audience, they can go more in-depth with their thoughts on that main point without reading from a script. When the designer is done explaining the main point, they will move on to read the next sentence on the list aloud. They’ll repeat these actions for the duration of the presentation.

Presentation practice
Next, the designer should practice giving the full presentation, using the slides, without an audience. The designer should remember to:

Practice aloud, so they can identify and edit any awkward phrasings or speed bumps. 

Verbalize the images the slides are displaying. For example, if there is an image of a screen design, describe the details of that image out loud. This ensures an inclusive presentation accessible to people with visual impairments.

Afterwards, the designer should consider the following questions: 

Am I being concise? Did I stick to the main points I need the audience to remember?

Is my tone conversational? Did I sound robotic or like I’m reading from a script? 

Did I use stories effectively, including relatable and specific examples to illustrate points?

Did I allow pauses in my delivery? 

Did I appear confident?

Did I practice making eye contact by addressing different locations around the room?

Presentation review
It’s also a good idea to record the presentation so you can review it and see how you did.  You can use a smartphone’s video recording capabilities or a computer equipped with a camera. On a computer, a simple method to record while sharing the slides is to utilize the “record” and “share your screen” features available in video conference apps like Google Meet or Zoom. It may take a few tries to record a version of the presentation ready for evaluation, but you should keep going until you have captured your entire presentation and are happy with it.

Considerations
If the designer was  able to record their presentation, they should  pause and evaluate how they did. The rubric below will help inform them of what they did well and where they could improve.

Key takeaways
The designer created an effective, formative and engaging presentation for the Dog Walking app by creating and including all the necessary slide elements. The elements in the presentation include the: 

Template

Introduction slide

Project background

Study details

Research themes

Insights

Recommendations

All these elements tell part of the story behind the research. They educate the audience on why they chose what to research, how they did it, and the conclusions they found. Once the designer finished building their presentation, they prepared for presenting and delivering the presentation. The designer included notes in the notes section of the slide deck on the key points they wanted to discuss with the audience on each slide. Before the actual presentation, the designer practiced giving the presentation, practicing what they would say out loud to an empty room. This allowed the designer to get any nerves out and hear how sentences and phrases sound out loud rather than on paper.
