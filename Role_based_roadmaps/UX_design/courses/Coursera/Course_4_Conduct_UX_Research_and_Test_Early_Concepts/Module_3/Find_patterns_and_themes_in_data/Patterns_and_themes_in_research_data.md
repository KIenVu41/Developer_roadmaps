Identifying Patterns

Look for groupings of sticky notes on your affinity diagram, as clusters often indicate patterns in user feedback.
For instance, multiple sticky notes related to booking recurring dog walkers reveal a potential user need.
Transforming Patterns into Themes

Themes connect the patterns you've identified to the overall user experience.
For example, the pattern of users wanting to book recurring dog walkers translates to the theme: "Most participants feel that being able to make a recurring booking would offer them more options on the app."
Benefits of Affinity Diagrams

Affinity diagrams are great for quickly identifying themes in your research data because they visually represent connections between different data points.
This visual organization helps you move from raw data to meaningful insights about your product's design.
