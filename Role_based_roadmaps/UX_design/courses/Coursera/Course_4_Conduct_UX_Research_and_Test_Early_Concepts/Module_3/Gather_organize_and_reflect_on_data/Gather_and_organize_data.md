Gathering and Organizing Data

After a usability study, gather all observations, ideally written on sticky notes, in one place.
Organize the data using affinity diagramming, a method that groups similar observations together.
Affinity Diagramming

Create clusters based on common themes or relationships between observations.
Compare sticky notes one by one, grouping those that represent similar issues or feedback.
Benefits of Affinity Diagramming

Helps to visually identify patterns and themes in user feedback.
Provides a flexible way to group and regroup observations as needed.
