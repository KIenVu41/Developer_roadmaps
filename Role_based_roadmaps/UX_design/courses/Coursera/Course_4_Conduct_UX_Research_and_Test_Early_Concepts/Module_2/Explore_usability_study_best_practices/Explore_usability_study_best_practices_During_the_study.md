Effective Communication During Moderated Usability Studies

Ask open-ended questions, such as "How do you think that went?", to encourage participants to provide detailed feedback rather than simple yes or no answers.
If you need clarification on a participant's feedback, ask follow-up questions, such as "Tell me more about that" or "Can you expand on that?".
Techniques for Handling Unclear Feedback

When unsure about a participant's meaning, try summarizing their response and allow them to confirm or correct your interpretation, but avoid doing this immediately after their initial response to prevent leading them to a particular answer.
Remember to prioritize open-ended and follow-up questions before summarizing for confirmation.
