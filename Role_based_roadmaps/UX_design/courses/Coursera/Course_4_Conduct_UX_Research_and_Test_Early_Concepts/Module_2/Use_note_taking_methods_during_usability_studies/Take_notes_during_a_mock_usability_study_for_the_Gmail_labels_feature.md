Activity Introduction
You’ve learned about the importance of taking good notes during usability studies, and how to take notes using a spreadsheet. This review will demonstrate how a UX designer applied those note-taking skills in a practice usability study. After reading this review, you’ll have a clearer understanding of what aspects of a study are most important to document, and how to organize your notes for future use. These skills will help you when you are conducting your own usability studies as a UX designer.  

In this practice scenario, you’ll review the work of a UX designer who conducted a usability study for the Gmail labels feature. Labels is a feature in Gmail inboxes that allows users to categorize their emails under different headings. The following video is a recording of one participant’s experience while attempting to complete a set of assigned tasks having to do with the Gmail labels feature. The UX designer reviewed this recording, then used a note-taking spreadsheet to document their observations about the user’s experience with Gmail labels.

Prepare the spreadsheet
To start their review of the results of the usability study, the designer began their notetaking by adding the name of the participant, Jordan, in to the blue box in Row 1, Column A of their spreadsheet. Then, they filled out the remainder of the spreadsheet based on what was observed about the participant in the video. 

The designer then labeled the first five columns of the spreadsheet with the usability study topics most important for taking notes on and assessing. Those categories include:

Tasks participants complete. Recorded in Column A.

The click path, or sequence of actions, a participant follows for each task. Recorded in Column B.

Observations about participant behaviors, feelings, and pain points as they interact with the product. Recorded in Column C.

Direct quotes from participants that highlight parts of their experience. Recorded in Column D.

How easy or difficult it was for the participant to complete each task. Recorded in Column E.

The designer also added a space at the bottom of these columns where any additional noteworthy observations could be made during the study.

Note: At the end of this review, you will get access to a copy of the designer’s spreadsheet to view their work for yourself. 

Watch participant videos and record observations
The designer then reviewed the following recording of usability study participant, Jordan. The designer used their spreadsheet to note their observations of the participant's interactions with the Gmail labels feature. 

Participant A: Transcript


Tasks
As they listened to the participant’s audio recording, the designer filled in the task column with the prompt number and the specific directions of that task. Here is what they wrote: 

Prompt 1: If I said "Let's set up Gmail labels for your email inbox," what do you think you might use this feature for? 

Prompt 2: Let's open Gmail in a web browser on a desktop computer. Now try to create a new label called "Shopping." How would you go about doing that? 

Prompt 3: Let's say you now wanted to change the color of the "Shopping" label to your favorite color. How would you do that?

Prompt 4: Finally, try to make a sub label named "Receipts." 

Prompt 5: How do you think you'd improve the setting up of a label?

Click Path
Next, the designer filled in the “Click Path” column, paying careful attention to how the participant navigated the site. They were sure to record the exact path the participant took to complete the labeled task. You’ll notice that for some tasks, the task didn’t require any particular click path to complete the task, such as Prompt 1 and Prompt 5. For those tasks, the designer wrote “N/A” for the click path cell. Here is what the designer recorded for the “click path” column: 

Task 1: N/A

Task 2: Open inbox > Scroll sidebar > New browser tab > Navigate to Google search > Search "How to create a Gmail label" > Open help article > Navigate to inbox > Scroll sidebar > Select "Create new label" > Enter label name > Select "Create" 

Task 3: Open inbox > Scroll sidebar > Select "shopping" label > Navigate to inbox > Select ellipsis next to "shopping" label > Select preferred label color

Task 4: Open inbox > Scroll sidebar > Select ellipsis next to "shopping" label > Navigate to inbox

Task 5: N/A

Observations
Here is where you’ll start to discover the real value of careful notetaking. In the cells under the column “observations,” the notetaker recorded what they observed of the participant’s behaviors, opinions, and attitudes, including any errors they made, issues they had, or areas of confusion they experienced while trying to complete tasks. As they filled out this section, the designer listened to the recording multiple times to gather as much information as possible. Here is what they wrote for the observations column: 

Task 1:

Participant didn't understand the appeal of labels

Participant felt too overwhelmed by the number of emails in their inbox to know where to begin

Task 2: 

Participant didn't know where to find labels

Participant scanned inbox and scrolling sidebar but couldn't find labels

Participant expressed frustration at not being able to find labels

Participant quickly gave up searching their inbox and went to the internet for help

Participant went through many steps to accomplish their goal

Participant said they understood the value of the feature once they were able to find it

Task 3: 

Participant didn't know where to find label settings at first

Participant used trial and error to reach label settings color menu

Once the participant was in the menu it was clear how to change the color of the label"

Task 4: 

Participant didn't know where to begin looking for sub labels

Participant tried navigating to label settings menu because it worked previously

Participant became frustrated and gave up when the settings menu didn't bring them where they wanted and no other solution was apparent

Participant did not complete task until after the study was over

Participant was not familiar with what sub labels are or why they might be valuable

Task 5:

Participant is frustrated that labels don't feel more intuitive to use

Quotes
For this section, the designer recorded any particularly informative quotes that the participant made while trying to complete the tasks. You’ll notice the designer gathered both positive and negative quotations — anything to help understand how the user responded to the design. Here are the quotes the designer recorded: 

Task 1:

"I don't really know if I see how helpful this would be."

"My inbox is so full of emails I'm not sure how this would make it more organized."

Task 2: 

"Ugh, this is honestly super confusing, I don't even know where this would be." 

"Okay, honestly, I'm going to give up and Google it. This is so confusing." 

"It's confusing to me why Gmail has this feature, and then hides it."

"Now that I'm able to find this feature, I can see how you might use labels sort of like a folder. Maybe they should rename it 'Folders'."

Task 3: 

"This is confusing because I just clicked on the color of the label, but it just goes to the emails. There isn't any way to change the label's color. Let me go back ..." 

"This was just pretty challenging altogether. Normally, you'd think to change the color right where you'd click on it. Instead I had to hover and find these secret dots. Not ideal, but I'd eventually find it."

Task 4: 

"Let's try those three dots again. Those seemed useful, even though they're basically hidden."

"This is confusing, I don't see anything here about sub labels."

"I eventually figured it out... but I don't really understand why you'd use a sub label or what you'd really want it for." 

"I also don't know if nesting and sub label mean the same thing."

Task 5: 

"I think creating new labels should be front and center."

"Changing the color would be a lot better if you could just click on the actual colored area next to the label."

"I don't understand why Gmail hides the label feature. I mean, it's pretty much buried under settings. "

Task Completion
The designer then marked whether the participant completed the tasks or not in the “Task Completion” column, using a 3-point scale. They marked a “1” if the participant found the task easy to complete. They marked a “2” if the task was completed with difficulty, and a “3” for tasks that were not completed. Much like the “click path” column, some tasks were not able to be marked using this system. For those types of tasks, the designer marked them “N/A.” Here is what the designer recorded for the “Task Completion” column: 

N/A

Key takeaways
Now that you’ve reviewed how a designer took notes during a usability study, you discovered how organizing your notes by task sets you up for a much more efficient review later on in the design process. You learned it is important for UX designers to listen to the recordings of usability study participants multiple times to gather all of the information they need. You also learned which parts of the recording to emphasize in your notes, and what can be left out. Now you’re ready to do some notetaking on your own usability studies.
