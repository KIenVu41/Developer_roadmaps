Notetaking in Usability Studies

Taking notes during usability studies helps capture thoughts, summarize participant experiences, and highlight important quotes for reports, even if the session is recorded.
Notes can include observations about participants' body language, tone of voice, and word choices, providing insights into their emotions and difficulties.
It's important to be mindful of potential biases when interpreting nonverbal cues and consider asking participants for clarification.
Who Takes Notes and Collaboration

While UX researchers often lead and take notes during usability studies, it's beneficial for other team members to participate and take notes from their perspectives.
Different team members, such as UX writers and UX designers, may notice different aspects of the user experience, leading to more comprehensive insights.
At Google, teams collaborate by consolidating and distilling their notes into key insights that inform the design process.
Notetaking Methods

There's no one-size-fits-all approach to notetaking, and various methods exist, including using paper, sticky notes, or spreadsheets.
The choice of method depends on personal preference and the complexity of the study.
