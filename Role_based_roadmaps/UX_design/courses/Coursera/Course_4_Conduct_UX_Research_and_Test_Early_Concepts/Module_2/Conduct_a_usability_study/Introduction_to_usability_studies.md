What is a Usability Study?

It's a research method to evaluate the ease of use of a design, where researchers observe participants interacting with a product.
These studies provide valuable user feedback, enabling design teams to identify areas for improvement.
Conducting a Usability Study

Usability studies can be conducted at various stages: with early ideas (concept testing), interactive prototypes (most common), or even complete products.
A typical study involves participants navigating a prototype while researchers gather feedback through observation and sometimes post-interaction interviews.
Benefits of Usability Studies

They offer a low-risk way to test designs and gather user feedback, leading to product improvements.
While feedback might reveal areas for improvement, it ultimately contributes to a better user experience.
