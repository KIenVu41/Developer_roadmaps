The Union is a user-defined data type in C language that can contain elements of the different data types just like structure. But unlike structures, all the members in the C union are stored in the same memory location. Due to this, only one member can store data at the given instance.

# Syntax of Union in C
## C Union Declaration
In this part, we only declare the template of the union, i.e., we only declare the membersâ€™ names and data types along with the name of the union. No memory is allocated to the union in the declaration.
```
union union_name {
    datatype member1;
    datatype member2;
    ...
};
```
Keep in mind that we have to always end the union declaration with a semi-colon.

## Different Ways to Define a Union Variable
We need to define a variable of the union type to start using union members. There are two methods using which we can define a union variable.

### 1. Defining Union Variable with Declaration
```
union union_name {
    datatype member1;
    datatype member2;
    ...
} var1, var2, ...;
```

### 2. Defining Union Variable after Declaration
```
union union_name var1, var2, var3...;
```
where union_name is the name of an already declared union.

## Access Union Members
We can access the members of a union by using the ( . ) dot operator just like structures.
```
var1.member1;
```
where var1 is the union variable and member1 is the member of the union.

The above method of accessing the members of the union also works for the nested unions.
```
var1.member1.memberA;
```

## Initialization of Union in C
The initialization of a union is the initialization of its members by simply assigning the value to it.
```
var1.member1 = some_value;
```
One important thing to note here is that only one member can contain some value at a given instance of time.

**Example of Union**
```
#include <stdio.h>
 
// union template or declaration
union un {
    int member1;
    char member2;
    float member3;
};
 
// driver code
int main()
{
 
    // defining a union variable
    union un var1;
 
    // initializing the union member
    var1.member1 = 15;
 
    printf("The value stored in member1 = %d",
           var1.member1);
 
    return 0;
}
```

## Size of Union
The size of the union will always be equal to the size of the largest member of the array. All the less-sized elements can store the data in the same space without any overflow.

**Example 1: C program to find the size of the union**
```
#include <stdio.h>
 
// declaring multiple unions
union test1 {
    int x;
    int y;
} Test1;
 
union test2 {
    int x;
    char y;
} Test2;
 
union test3 {
    int arr[10];
    char y;
} Test3;
 
// driver code
int main()
{
    // finding size using sizeof() operator
    int size1 = sizeof(Test1);
    int size2 = sizeof(Test2);
    int size3 = sizeof(Test3);
 
    printf("Sizeof test1: %d\n", size1);
    printf("Sizeof test2: %d\n", size2);
    printf("Sizeof test3: %d", size3);
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**
```
Sizeof test1: 4
Sizeof test2: 4
Sizeof test3: 40
```
